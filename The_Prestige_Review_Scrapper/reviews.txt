Great movie with Great actors writers and twists.Something that i didn't see anybody said about it that rivalry between two magicians is reference to Tesla and Edison's rivalry.
In the beginning they worked together, then became opponents. I think Borden is Tesla cause he always was more talented than Angier (Edison) who stole Borden's idea.Surely on of the best movies in this century, be sure to watch it more than one time.

The Prestige, adapted from an award winning novel of the same name by Christopher Priest, is an intricate tale of passion, intrigue, deceit and obsession about two illusionists, whose morbid covetousness for absolute supremacy in their profession engenders a fierce rivalry that turns internecine and ultimately consumes them. Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) at the start of their careers are highly ambitious young men assisting an elderly illusionist named Milton. Borden's incessant longing for innovation leads to the accidental death of Angier's wife. Borden marries Sarah and his apparent happiness further aggravates the sense of revulsion in Angier's heart. Angier's vindictive intervention during a bullet catch trick causes Borden to lose his two fingers. Though these events sowed the seeds of implacable hatred, but it is the unremitting yearning of their perpetually insatiable egos to outperform each other that eventually drives them to perdition.Angier starts performing with the sobriquet "The Great Danton" with Cutter (Michael Caine) as his illusion engineer, while Borden with the stage name "The Professor" with Fellon as his engineer. Angier is an adept showman, but lacks the technical prowess. On the contrary, Borden is highly skillful, but lacks the taste for grandeur and showmanship. Each regards the other as his only obstacle (owing to their bitterly intertwined past) and this starts a series of events in which each tries to stymie the other by any means possible (sabotage, abduction, incrimination and even killings). Awed by the apparent genuineness of Borden's version of "The Transported Man" and inveigled by Borden's deliberate misdirection, Angier travels miles and spends a fortune to approach an ingenious scientist named Nikola Tesla (David Bowie) in order to cajole him into building a machine for him (a machine that could help him outperform Borden). Nikola Tesla is an apostle of Alternating Current (and rightly thinks it to be superior to Direct Current), and is under immense pressure imparted by Thomas Edison (ruthless advocator of Direct Current) and his men, who are after Tesla. As Edison's men close in on him, Tesla runs out of time and hence funds for his research and is forced to oblige Angier, who is his very last client. Tesla flees the scene shortly after fulfilling his promise to Angier (not without leaving him a strong note of caution against the use of his invention), whose ever increasing skepticism in Tesla is placated by the efficacy of his masterful invention. Using Tesla's machine, Angier introduces his own version of "The Transported Man", which becomes an instant success, but in lieu of a terrible self-sacrifice (that Angier has to make every night while performing). As the story culminates, the viewer is startled with many revelations including the mental and physical torments that Borden's complex character undergoes owing to his total devotion towards his art.The success of an act of illusion solely depends upon the deftness with which its three parts viz. the Pledge, the Turn, and the Prestige are performed. Similarly, for a movie to be a success, its three main aspects i.e. screenplay, direction, and acting are ought to be top-notch. Christopher Nolan incredibly manages to strike all the right cords with The Prestige. His riveting maneuvers coupled with his ingenious auteur skills aggrandize the brilliance of the movie ten-fold. Nolan succeeds in having a dream assemblage of actors with almost everyone giving a memorable performance. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are superb in their lead roles. Michael Caine shines in his low-key portrayal of Cutter, an ordinary part made to appear extraordinary through sheer brilliance; vintage Caine. David Bowie as Nikola Tesla and Andy Serkis (Gollum of LOTR) as Alley (Tesla's assistant) are stupendous in their cameos. Scarlet Johansson also manages to give a scintillating portrayal as Borden's paramour, Olivia.The movie is a roller-coaster of a ride with intriguingly intertwined subplots and masterful time switching, which makes it one of a kind and an ultimate masterpiece. The uncanny feat of Nolan to manifest a motion picture, which forays the realms of Mystery, Thrill, Sci-fi and Fantasy, is truly exemplary and makes the movie a contemporary classic. The movie is a tapestry of twists and turns, which evinces its overwhelming potential to bewitch the masses and satiate even the most esoteric viewers. The questions that it incessantly asks of the viewers can only be answered after repetitive viewings, with each viewing seeking utmost attention of the viewer. The only question that I would ask of the viewer is: "Are you watching closely?" A must watch for anyone, who has nothing against giving his mind a rigorous exercise and his body an adrenaline rush. 10/10

What "The Prestige" does very well is recreate a period of show business history near the turn of the century in which competition between magicians was serious and intense. The workings of the complicated illusions are gorgeously brought to life via smartly detailed apparatus that replicate the actual mechanics of Victorian legerdemain. Much of the film rings very true, such as the all-consuming obsessions of the lead characters to be the best and outdo all others. It's an easy step to accept that such unwavering determination spills over into deadly territory, as rival magicians suave Rupert Angier (a riveting performance by Hugh Jackman) and audacious Alfred Borden (Christian Bale effortlessly playing a brooding lower-class Brit) each seek to wreak continuing revenge upon the other.The story, though adapted from a novel, feels like a perfect fit for director Nolan's sensibilities, as the machinations of the two men become increasingly convoluted during a back-and-forth tug of wits that keeps you guessing in the style of Nolan's "Memento." As the game grows increasingly deadly, and threatens to consume all they love, the film becomes a fascinating study in single-mindedness.The work is epic in sweep, beautifully filmed, and strongly acted. The only odd note in casting is David Bowie as Nikola Tesla (he looks nothing like the actual Tesla, if you care about these sort of things, and his appearance calls attention to itself as superstar casting often does), but Mr. Bowie holds his own. Solid performances are all around, with Michael Caine adding dignity and depth as the old master, Scarlett Johanssen as the as the lovely stage assistant who becomes the third point in a twisted love triangle, and even Andy Serkis (Gollum!) in a memorable supporting role.The introduction of Tesla adds yet another twist, as the film shifts from real-but-possible stage illusion to steam-punkish sci-fi. This transition is a hard note to pull off, since the beginning of the film doesn't quite suggest such a direction, but if you're willing to let Nolan lead you on the journey into increasingly fantastic realms, the narrative rewards you with thought-provoking moral and dramatic exploration of the issues raised.A truly entertaining movie, and an original, unusual, dark ride -- well worth seeing in a theater for its grand scope and vision.

I couldn't help myself. I just kept saying "wow, what a beautifully crafted film," all the way home, and around my house when I arrived home. I have not been so captured and entertained in a long time. I was especially enamored with the screen writing and how tightly and beautifully the visual metaphors tied in with the writing, and with the impact of the human message about obsession, competition and retribution carried to the extreme. One can relate to this personal human struggle for victory over another at all costs on a much grander scale, as the two magicians could easily be symbolic of how leaders of countries come to blows with each other, at the expense of their women and children -- something we struggle with right now in our world. There are deeper layers of this film that will be uncovered over time.Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale and Sir Michael Caine all contributed stunning, emotional performances. Rebecca Hall, who played Sarah to Bale's Alfred Borden, turned in a highly charged performance as well, making Scarlett Johansson's Olivia flat in comparison. And although some people thought the plot line a bit tedious, I found it to be refreshingly complex and engaging, while not being so complex as to lose you. If you can't follow this one, you've been watching television too long. And who cares if the illusions are mundane or scientifically unbelievable? Isn't that what both movies and illusions ask us to do? To suspend disbelief? Meantime, there's a message in its madness. Hello.The film is visually moody and evocative, easily transporting you into the time period. What more could you ask for? A film is a visual medium and this one is a visual ten. The acting is superb as well as the plot. It keeps you interested; it keeps you guessing right to the shocking but most appropriate end.It asks you, what is one willing to sacrifice for the "prestige?"I think this one's an Oscar definite.

I went to see a critics preview of The Prestige this afternoon and to  my surprise I found the film to be one of the best I have seen all year  so far, and that writers can come up with an excellent script it they  would only try a little harder. The acting performances by Hugh  Jackman, Christian Bale and Michael Caine were the best I have see in  a long while. The only objection I had to the film was that it was a  little long, but once you leave the theater you will discuss the film  and it many twists and turns. My wife and myself discussed it all the  way home from the movie theater. This is a winner and should be up for  some academy award statues, and my recommendation is go see this as  soon as you can, you will not be disappointed.

I have to say this is one of the best movies i have seen this year, i was not expecting it to be that good. There's twist after twist, and when you think there is no more, there will be. Great performances and ever better plot. I highly recommend this movie to all ages.New idea for a movie, and they succeeded it at it greatly. It will have you thinking every time you see a magician on TV!i had to give this movie a 10/10, and i only have 4 movies that i would rate that way in my life time. If there is anything you do this year, make it a trip to watch this movie!I hope you enjoy it as much as i did.

What makes this movie so incredible is that while it is indeed a movie about magicians (or illusionists) it is also a complex character study about how self destructive obsessions are with a sideline love story and a sci-fi twist. A unique plot with an amazing cast--any of whom could believably garner an Oscar nomination. Christian Bale was amazing in one of his rare cockney performances. We already know from Kate and Leopold how well Hugh Jackman plays a distinguished English gent. He's absolutely priceless. Is there any point in discussing Sir Michael Caine? He brings polish to the movie. This is the kind of flick that you can discuss for weeks after. The plot is so detailed and complete and open to interpretation. My friend and I have been discussing various nuances of this film for the past 3 weeks. It definitely stays with you.

This was the best movie I have seen in at least the past two years. Most movies have me leave the theater feeling like I wasted 8 dollars or so. So many movies lately have left me feeling like I wasted away precious hors of my life that could have been spent doing better things. Yet this movie was truly a masterpiece and kept me guessing the whole time. The acting was superb and so was the plot. I usually can predict the outcomes of movies pretty early on. And usually I can see the twist the writer planned. With this movie I was still left wondering into the last 5 minutes of the movie. I can't wait to own this on DVD.

You don't need to know anything but Christopher Nolan made the movie and that's the bottom line!

The final reveal in a magic trick is the most thrilling experience. So is that of this movie. The Prestige is a masterful exercise in storytelling with superb direction and powerful performances. I was floored by the deftness of how Nolan weaved and juxtaposed the non linear narrative so flawlessly. What makes this movie so incredible is that while it is indeed a movie about magicians (or illusionists) it is also a complex character study about how self destructive obsessions are with a sideline love story and a sci-fi twist - very unique.

The Prestige is directed by Christopher Nolan and stars Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale as two magicians that worked side by side until a tragic accident lead them to separate and now, they develop a deadly feud between them. This is a fantastic movie. One of Nolan's best yet again. Nolan is such an inspiration, he hasn't made a bad film, and I hope he doesn't. This guy knows how to make a film. The story was written by his brother, and Chris turned it into a film, just like "Memento". Christian Bale gives a great performance as Alfred Borden, a magician known as the Professor. Same goes for Hugh Jackman as Robert Angier. Very well depicted characters, each with a sole purpose. The writing in this film is excellent. Nolan brought the script to life with these nailbiting scenes. The death of Angier's wife was the point in which Alfred and Robert separated their friendship and became rivals. They then go on their separate performances and make new tricks. Some of the tricks would be sabotaged by the either Robert or Alfred, for instance, one scene where Alfred is displaying a trick with a gun, he has a volunteer. That volunteer is Angier, who takes the gun and slips in a real bullet then shoots off Alfred's fingers. That was where the violence started in their rivalry. The friction between Angier and Borden is very great. Hugh and Bale have great chemistry on screen together and I love how they got back at each other. The death of Borden's wife, Sarah, was unexpected for me. That was a mighty surprise where I was like WHAT?! Then, at the end, the plot twist was revealed, where Alfred actually had a twin who was his double. His double was the one that was going to prison and he was actually the other man, I forgot his name, who then revealed himself to Angier at the end. It was a very good twist and I loved it. However, there is one thing I didn't like. During the time Angier went to see Tesla, played by David Bowie, there was always a shift in seasons, where it snowed and then it was green again, and it was confusing to get my head around it, but that is all. Overall: 9/10

This movie was truly a game-changer for me. I initially saw it simply because I enjoyed some members of the cast so much (Bale, Caine, Bowie), but I left the theatre in awe. It is such a well-written, layered, intense, character driven story on par with Faustus or Jekyll and Hyde in terms of characters that are overly driven by their obsessions. It invites you to watch in the first lines of dialogue and from that point forward, you hardly have a choice. One of Nolan's strengths is that he doesn't shy away from difficult stories to tell. None of the characters are entirely likable. It's hard to pick someone to root for, but that is one of the things that makes them so human. Jackman and Bale are both fine actors that attack their roles with tremendous capability and Rebecca Hall is one of the best discoveries I've had in movies. Even Johansson, who is easily the weakest link, was used sparingly and didn't detract from the movie. The plot is fascinating and leads to an immensely satisfying ending. I can't watch this enough times.

Omg. possibly the greatest film ever made. the most genius story ever put to film. I keep saying it's hard for me to believe that it's even possible to come up with such a smart story. Amazing acting throughout. Intense throughout. Seems to get better with each viewing (5 viewings)
SPOILERS
after watching this for a 5th time, i still picked up on things that i don't think i noticed before, which is so impressive of this movie. the biggest one was that i could tell which brother was being portrayed by bale. the one that got married was nicer and calmer and more comforting. the one that sexes scarlett josexy is meaner, short-tempered and cockier. the fact that i could tell who was who, based on very subtle differences in his acting style, he's the GOAT for a reason. bale is a master of his craft.

I continue to be blown away at how fantastic this film is. It is executed with extreme precision. Every aspect of the film, all the way from visuals to the character development, is masterful.I'm not sure how it fared awards wise upon its release, but it should have racked up quite a few. The story is wonderfully layered, the acting is superb, the directed is spectacular, etc. I can't find anything about this film that I would change.Congratulations to the entire team that put this project together. I consider it one of the best films of all time.If you have the opportunity I strongly urge that you check this film out. I think you'll be glad you did.

This movie is beyond brilliant. I never payed that much attention to it the first two or three times I watched it on TV, but god, oh god, is it worth watching again! Every time! And now, when I finally sat down to watch it, I realized how much I had missed. I think it's one of the greatest movies ever created. Packed with subtle references, The Prestige itself is a magic trick and indeed, you have to watch closely. And when you do, you find yourself compelled by the seemingly harmless passion of the artist that is soon revealed to be a dangerous obsession which shows to what lengths a person is willing to go to and what sacrifices he's willing to make to be greater than his rivals and to be the very best he can.

Brilliantly paced, wonderful actors and stunning storytelling.

I say "ending", but since the ending is given away about 2/3 into the movie, its not really at the end. That is just where it is confirmed, to those who were in disbelief that such a great film could be utterly ruined.Plot lines are elsewhere, I am just going to explain why you should skip this movie. First, I will admit that except for this truly fatal flaw, it is an excellent movie. And that's why this was so incredibly disappointing. The movie takes place in the 19th century. Here on earth. And there is a central mystery that is woven throughout the film, and you wrack your brain trying to figure it out. You follow every twist and turn, scrutinize every detail, develop and evaluate theories on what the answer could be, and eagerly anticipate the revealing. And then, all of a sudden, its science fiction. They had a cloning machine. How completely cowardly a solution that was. If you are watching Star Trek or something, you know that you are in the world of science fiction, where anything goes. A cloning machine is a formal possibility, and if that ends up to be the explanation, you fully accept it because it makes sense in that reference frame. But it is entirely out of place when you are supposedly in a "period piece." Turns out, it was never a period piece, it was science fiction pretending to be a period piece. That's dumb. You can't develop some clever puzzle, and then wimp out and never solve it, but instead just invoke science fiction. Extremely lazy and irresponsible.This reminds me of another terrible move, The Forgotten. Same exact fatal flaw (except the rest of the movie wasn't that great either). There's a mystery, with clues and evidence that are seemingly impossible to reconcile, and you can't wait to find out how its being done. And then, they tell you its aliens from outer space. Gee, thanks. Stupid stupid stupid. Its more angering with The Prestige because it was so much the better movie, and they ruined it for no reason. A cloning machine over 100 years ago? How freaking stupid.

Reading these drooling reviews, I have to wonder what has gone wrong with the movie-viewing community of late.This film is nothing more than a very expensive exercise in overstatement. How many times can we possibly hit our audience over the head with the same exact symbolism? How blatantly obvious can we make our "elaborate plot twists" by the end of the film? Hugh Jackman's closing speech is perfectly typical of this film. Shot and dying on the floor, he suddenly comes to this very drawn out and very boringly shot epiphany about how he was never REALLY obsessed with finding out his opponent's secrets. He actually traveled thousands of miles, spent countless amounts of money, (How did he have this, by the way?) shot, stalked, kidnapped, and did his very best to destroy his opponent's life, but he actually did it for "the look on their (the audience) faces." Please.And plot twists? No no no, my friends. There is precisely one plot twist, and it is given away by the "tease" at the beginning of the film. As soon as you see that the hat doesn't leave, you know the rest of the movie. Okay, it clones things. He makes new and kills one of himself every time. It's not a huge leap in logic, but the filmmakers see fit to treat the audience like a bunch of Neanderthal second graders.Finally, we are supposed to like the magician/twin that makes it back to his daughter in the end. Forgetting of course, the fact that he broke Hugh Jackman's legs, killed his wife, crushed that innocent woman's hand, and oh yes, shot and killed his rival. But he was justified, right? WRONG. Once again, Hollywood comes out with the kind of ambiguous, almost-moral movie that makes you just cringe with the pansy-butt quality of their statements.Please do both me and yourself a favor and skip this tripe.

If you think this film is mediocre or just a "period piece" then you have to think again because the true depth of this plot cannot be realized without watching repeatedly.I have watched it through several times and still can't tell if the Michael Caine character was the true mastermind.This screenplay could play in any time or place, even with unknown actors, and still generate eternal wonder.Too many directors rely on gratuitous violence, expensive action sequences, big name actors and grandiose sets/CGI to wow the viewers Christopher Nolan is an unmitigated genius and doesn't need any of those tricks.

Great movie and best movie I've seen directed by Christopher Nolan. The story of the movie was great and I did not expect the end. Most of the film's characters were excellent, and Tesla's appearance in the film was excellent. The acting was excellent, especially from Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale who were dazzling in the film, the film embodies the period of the end of the nineteenth century, a great film.

The only thing I knew before watching this was; There are two magicians, and one of the best plot twists ever. While watching I was constantly invested in it, and enjoyed the whole ride. When I realised that Angeir was still alive, I thought "Okay that was unexpected, but one of the greatest plot twists ever? Naah"Never the less at the time I thought that this movie was really incredible and I was happy that I watched it. But then, as I thought the biggest things were over, the plot twist is revealed and I was left in awe. My jaw quite literally dropped, and I sat there trying to comprehend what had happened. It was so amazing that I started chuckling in amazement. Cristopher Nolas never fails, he could post a video of paint drying and he would still manage to make it a masterpiece

An all star cast in this one keeping you guessing. Great story and great acting, never a dull moment.

I don't know how any movie buff would not see the twists coming from a mile away. One can see when a twist is done in a tasteful and careful manner, and when the film makers are desperately trying to fit square pegs into round holes. Credit must be given to Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine, and David Bowie for their superb acting. However Christian Bale(who I normally like) and Scarlett Johansson were terrible. A few of my specific gripes: 1. The ending is given away in the first minute. Christian Bale is accused of killing Hugh Jackman. EVERY MOVIE that starts with this presentation ends up with the supposedly accused being innocent.2. The cat was duplicated. Surely by this alone anyone can deduce that Jackman was also duplicated. Hence the pointless "solving the puzzle" scenes.3. Mystery/suspense turned into Steven Spielberg's Amazing Stories science fiction halfway through the movie.4. Jackman conveniently tears up the Transported Man secret(which was a driving plot) so he can be shot by Bale's twin brother.5. Jackman conveniently finds an exact look-alike in a bar.6. Bale's wife amazingly knows which days he loves her and which he doesn't, in a dire attempt to connect the twin brother twist.7. I was terribly disappointed with Perabo's death scene and subsequent funeral. These were two important moments in the film and should have been emphasized and given more attention. "What knot did you tie?". "I don't know". "You don't know?".8. A supposedly "dead" Jackman trots in public without any concern of being recognized to have a contrived face to face dramatic effect with his nemesis.9. Just get a gun and shoot each other in the back. The movie would be over in 10 minutes and there would be no need for tantalizing sabotages.To conclude, this movie was made with the intention of "let's get in as many twists and turns possible" rather than "let's tell a good story with a twist".

Now this was a movie that made you stop and think and then think again, and then go buy a ticket to watch again and think. Most of the people in the audience looked stupefied at the end of this flick. No greater tribute can be given for a movie based on magicians, magic, and science fiction. This is every magicians dream and to do it through the cinema is quite a trick in itself. The performances are excellent and Christian Bale as always is the character in life and breathe. Hugh Jackman is so turning out to be more than an eye catcher and can act in the most excellent and gentlemanly fashion. Michael Caine.......when don't you turn in an awesome performance. Scarlett Johanson does an excellent job and surrounded by such thundering performances, how can she not excel in the pouted way of hers and it is put most excellently to use in this movie. Take the rabbit out of the hat and take a bow, this was definitely a magic trick of a movie.

In the beginning, where Borden tries to charm Sara, Sara's nephew would not cease to protest that the yellow bird's brother is missing (later shown smashed in its cage and dumped in the garbage). Although Borden shows that the yellow bird is alive and fine in its cage, the nephew persists with "where's it's brother?! you killed it! where's it's brother?!" (not exact quote). Borden's only reply is "sharp little fella" (something of the sort). I believe this is foreshadowing to Borden's true secret, hence his lack of a better explanation for the bird. Or perhaps it's all my imagination?? I also have the question of what did Borden supposedly lose as something dear to him at dinner (when he's drunk), if Tesla is not a secret but a disillusionment, then what is he speaking of??

A lot has been said about the film's beauty, but this is also an amazingly complex film and I think a lot of people didn't really get all that the first time. Some critics were upset about the twist ending while others were concerned with the sci-fi plot. To these people I say "Are you watching closely?" In retrospect, this film's cleverness comes from its plot that is structured similar to a magic trick. Both Angier and Borden's story, has a pledge, a turn and a prestige. In the film, they both share the same prestige; seemingly reappearing from the dead. The ultimate twist in the film is literally told to the audience several times, but as an audience we naturally doubt the obvious, and wish to be fooled. This is similar to a magic trick, we know the truth behind the magic; that it's not real, but only a great magician can, for a moment, make you doubt that truth. It's the magician's job, to quote the film, "sell it all the way through" and this film does just that. Even though you might have it figured out, the film gives you distractions that have you doubting it just long enough so when the pieces come together you realize what you just saw was something truly special. That's the beauty behind this film.The science fiction plot fits both visually and thematically. The film shows us that during this time period magicians had to change to keep up with the times, so they adopted more science fiction into their acts. This is why Borden and Angeir seek out Tesla. It brings closure to the other reoccurring theme in the film which is obsession, how far will one go? Their obsession to keep topping one another leads Angier to take it to the next level, but he goes too far, starts toying with real magic and ends up going to hell for it.

Thid movie is my favorite movie. This movie change my life.

How in the world is this in the top 250 movies of all-time? The performances are nothing to write home about- Bale's Cockney accent is laughable, as in it made me laugh the whole movie, the reason I first gave this movie a 3, Jackman might as well have been a statue, and apparently Nolan never told Caine that he wasn't still playing Alfred between Batman movies. The only way someone could enjoy this movie is if they were somehow "fooled" by the "twists". First of all, a twist is when you believe something and that something turns out not to be true. So there are no "twists" in this movie, because there is nothing to believe, the audience simply doesn't understand and the reason is eventually presented. Saying this movie has "twists" would be like saying someone performing card tricks has "twisted" your life. Second, I don't know how it's possible to be fooled by anything in this movie. It is obvious that Fallon is a double for Bale the entire movie, although I thought he was only a look-a-like, he was his twin brother. They say the entire movie you have to "live" your trick.They keep telling the wives and girlfriends "a part of me" and "I loved you yesterday" Then, how can anyone be fooled with anything in the ending? You know the machine clones things, why didn't you know Jackman was still alive.Which brings me to the point of what is this movie about exactly? It's about two loser magician twins, one of whom makes his wife commit suicide and the other denies his true love and gets hanged- all of this for what? Magic!! It's also about another loser magician who's wife drowns(the only real magic in the movie by the way)- and then receives a clone machine(now it's a sci-fi movie for some reason), which he uses to upstage the other two loser magicians (and mass murder), causing the remaining loser twin to shoot and kill him. And this is in the top 250? I take it back, I see the "twist" now.... that's magic!!

This film really annoyed the hell out of me. It is definitely an entry into the oeuvre of movies that are so obsessed by how clever its twists are that it forgets to worry about things such as sympathetic characterisation, naturalistic expositional dialogue, and, most crucially, the effective execution of said oh-so-clever twists.First, a few points about the script. The script is dreadful in parts, with exposition that may as well be spoken directly to camera. The characters, Hugh Jackman's in particular, seem unrounded and without any kind of back story - seemingly plopped into the middle of an obsessive pursuit without any explanation as to where said obsessions may have originated. As happens in so many Hollywood movies, the female roles are perfunctory up to the point of pastiche - did anyone else groan with anticipation of how banal and run-of-the-mill Scarlett Johansson would be? I'd like to see a studio movie that, in the absence of an integral love story, crowbars in some half-assed romance entirely for the sake of some demograph of dubious existence who are believed to not want to see a movie without some histrionic sexual politics.Now, on to those twists, of which there are two major ones. The first, whose set up is established very early on, is glaringly obvious. I spent most of the film seething with frustration as lines that, in what i guess the makers hoped would be in hindsight, are massively irritating 'clues' to the audience. All this is abrogated by the fact that it was all clear to me from the off (and i wasn't aware there was a twist to the film so i wasn't looking out for one), all due to the fact that essential production values fail to adequately disguise the twist. The second twist, which acts not only as plot but supposedly as a thematic comparison to the first, is what left me wanting my money back. The filmmakers seemed to have forgotten that suspension of disbelief must be eared through establishing what can an cannot happen in the world they have created. For example, in The Matrix, when we shown that it is Trinity's love for Neo that brings him back from the dead, the audience is able to accept this because the reality that has been established is one of sci-fi machines-rule-the-world type. We have been prepared to be asked to go along with the possible. The Prestige, a film that throughout its running time shows and tells us that the magic in the film is one rooted in realistic trickery and that the rivalry between the two main characters is based on which can come up with the cleverest ruse, believes that it does not need to ask the audience to suspend its disbelief before laying down the biggest of deus ex machina macguffins seen in recent cinema. We are expected to believe that within this realistic turn of the century world that a machine is invented that (through science, not magic) can do what remains impossible in the present. This 'twist' represents lazy, lazy storytelling - it is like the writers could not come up with an actual clever ending so just used their get out of jail free card instead.On the side, there are some very pretty things to look at, with impressive period detail and some imaginative compositions from Nolan. Michael Caine and Andy Serkis are both excellent, and its always nice to see David Bowie on screen, but thats where the acting plaudits stop. Bale and Jackman give in uncharismatic and unlikeable performances and Johanssen floats along on a wave of arbitrariness.I would say to avoid this film, unless you enjoy the energy that truly hating a film can give you, as it has to me.

In a film about magic and illusion, isn't it a shame that the makers cheat the audience who have waited patiently for the clever reveal. It's not so much a case of "how did they do that, it's impossible" as "that IS impossible". There's no magic trick at all, the whole conceit relies on a sci-fi teleporter/cloning machine which does not and never has existed. Well acted, well staged and filmed but the whole idea of the magic trick ending with a "prestige" is lost because, in this film, the trick has no prestige, just a sparkly device which, you feel, has been invented by the film-makers because they couldn't think up a clever ending. Twists and tricks are great in movies, provided they are believable and inventive. Doing the impossible is merely treating the audience as idiots.

...but it fell like a card-house. I really like the thought of the "its all about the sacrifices you make" plot but it just doesn't last. Up until Nikola Tesla did his cloning/teleport thingey I still had some hopes for the movie and I sat hoping that Tesla had faked the cloning just to get some more money when i saw the hats and cats on the ground. I genuinely hoped the filmmakers illustrated Tesla as a hoax, it sure seemed better than the movie getting all Star Trek! Unfortenately the writers didn't pick up that extra ace from their sleeves and the movie literally flat-lined and just died. Beam me up Scotty :(

Sorry, but I guess I'm going against the grain on this one. I remember when Michael O'Donoghue was writing for National Lampoon; he had a "how to write a short story" article. The thrust of the piece was -- if you get bored or can't figure out an ending, have your character get hit by a bus. This movie seems to take that approach.The 'miracle' invention that Tesla apparently provided Hugh Jackman's character, which allowed him to duplicate himself, is nowhere referenced in the movie. The ending is a cinematic equivalent of "then he got hit by a bus". In short, I think the audience was cheated. Apparently most of the people who commented on this movie didn't mind that, but I thought it lacked integrity.Beautiful cinematography, tortured accents, and a conceit that's actual a deceit. Not recommended.

wow. how did this slip so far under the radar for so long with so many people? the Oscars ignored it, audiences ignored it, i don't get how!!! the story has more twist and turns than if the usual suspects had a three-way with the 6th sense and se7en. the way you're rooting for hugh jackman's character then you're neutral then you're rooting for Christian bale's character then back again... it never stops!!! fantastic performances by everyone as well... bale as the better magician with the lousy showmanship, jackman as the man out for revenge who will stop at nothing to learn the other's secrets, caine as the man constantly finding out the type of men he's been dealing with. it just doesn't get any better. chris nolan you are a god.

As a fan of old Twilight Zone episodes, I love the surreal aspects of The Prestige, specifically Tesla's quest to create a transporting machine that can turn magic into reality. However, a friend of mine, who does not like this movie, sees this plot as an unfair cop-out. According to him, the film's writer breaks the rules of the film's reality when he allows Hugh Jackman's character to use Tesla's machine to duplicate himself in a science fiction-like manner.If the writer sees no problem including science fiction in this story, why not just give Hugh Jackman's character the ability to fly? Or better yet, why not have aliens transport Hugh Jackman's character across the stage? Neither option would be more absurd or unrealistic, and in my friend's opinion, both destroy the film's reality in the same manner.

A true mystery cannot include supernatural action or agents unknown to science, nor any physical impossibilities (or even improbabilities).The enjoyment that one gets from watching a mystery unfold is in the collection of clues by a gifted amateur detective (either a character in the story, or the audience itself with some aid from the script), the clever mis-direction and art of the author, and a satisfying conclusion.The conclusion is the key -- it must be innovative, and coherent. (Agatha Christie, of course, was the master. Everyone on the Orient Express did it; that's original, and satisfying. The police officer set the Mousetrap; that's original, and satisfying. The hanging judge faked his own death in order to direct suspicion elsewhere; that's original, and satisfying.) What is the point of crafting a lenghty story, and then saying at the end: "Yes, it all WAS possible, see? The existence of the *flibbertigibbet machine* means that it could have happened." A 'twist' that amounts to "I, the writer, can do whatever I damn well please" is simply hackneyed.'Electrical cloning' is impossible. It cannot be done. Saying it can -- and was, by Nikola Tesla -- is idiotic.While we're throwing around impossibilities concerning historical figures, we might as well just make a film about Queen Elizabeth I conquering Mars, or Julius Caesar inventing time travel using silver coins and sunshine. What an absolute waste of my time.PS. If the machine was a diversion -- all of the flashbacks and double-crosses muddied the story sufficiently to allow the possibility -- I still want to know why there are human forms in all of the many water tanks in the warehouse at the end of the film.The question the author wants us to ask is: are these the dead canaries, so to speak, or are they yet another layer of mis-direction?I think I can say this: if this were just another layer, and I am supposed to believe that the human forms are manniquins or stolen corpses, I am even more angry with the author. A pathetically low level of storytelling would have been reached.Both choices come out to the same result: a horrific stain on the good name of the mystery.

Let's face it, there aren't many good writers for cinema. Yet the bar has gotten higher while certain narrative structures have become more acceptable. Nolan has earned a place as one of the best without a Spanish surname. It seems he starts with a notion of multiple parallelisms in narrative, then fleshes them out using some of the techniques common in or best literature, but always envisioned first cinematically. The five parallelisms here are: Warring magicians (mirrored by the warring real life magicians Tesla and Edison). The realities of life and pretended or performed life, with the common fold of the play we see and the performance(s) they make. Multiple existence of beings Different slices of time as the narrative is unrolled backwards and forwards in bits. The way the stories are recounted in two overlapping diaries, each a lure. Pay particular attention to this, and the fairly literate references, starting with Van Helsing and covering at least a few Shakespearean phrases.Its therefore 5 times more clever, engaging and rewarding than "The Illusionist," itself a competent oneway fold.Spend some time with this. That Batman thing went over well with some folks, I know. But it was a waste of talent. This is where the man belongs. Welcome home Chris. Stay away from comics.The acting is irrelevant. Good thing.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.

If you didn't enjoy this film, well. You, I am afraid to say, have no taste in films whatsoever. I see people moaning about how they didn't understand the plot and how it was boring for them, that would probably be because you didn't WATCH the movie properly. It tells you from the very beginning to watch closely because this is a film that requires your full attention to understand and you will be well rewarded if you do. If not, you become one of those commenting with "I don't understand, omg it's such a bad film because I don't get it."The acting is amazing and the twist at the end of the film is not something that I saw coming. At times it is a little predictable, but all films have their moments and it certainly doesn't take away from the magic that it brings to the audience member.

I remember seeing 'The Illusionist' a couple of years back and I was so impressed as it was my first film of the genre (give me a break, I am 20 and I wasn't seeing many films of this kind back when I was a kid). Well, this is my second film of the same genre and they were both released in the same year, with my favourite actors - Hugh Jackman & Edward Norton. They are both strokes of genius, but this is the better one of the two, as this is more complex (much much more) than The Illusionist. I am glad that I saw this last night on TV. I didn't know anything about the story and I really enjoyed it.Every magic trick consists of three acts - the first is 'The Pledge', the second is 'The Turn' and the final, hardest, most important act is 'The Prestige'. Thus begins the story of The Prestige. The climax is shown in this scene itself, that of Angier being drowned and Borden just standing there. So, Borden is convicted of Angier's murder and is sentenced to death. Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) has stolen Borden's diary to unravel his 'Transported Man' trick and has went to Tesla to make his own machine, which is better than Borden's trick. Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) is a tormented man who doesn't want to part with his secret near his end, but doesn't have a choice if he has to see his young daughter grow up perfectly. Cutter (Michael Caine) is Angier's producer or something, but he's more like a close confidante rather than an employer.Then, the true story begins to reveal itself which is set in the 1900's. Borden and Angier have a long history. They are two rookie illusionists who work for the same man, Cutter. Borden had inadverdently caused the death of Angier's wife who was also his assistant. Then Borden has the audacity to tell Angier that he doesn't know which knot he tied on her, but it is not his fault really, he truly doesn't remember. Angier is a born showman who has everything that a magician should have, knack for misleading the audience easily. Borden is a more talented magician who doesn't have the showmanship, but he is improving constantly. Angier and Borden now entangle themselves into a life of dual in which neither can win, as we are shown at the starting itself. While Borden falls in love with Sarah, a sweet and beautiful young lady, Angier is sinking into a life of revenge against Borden. Olivia Wenscombe (Scarlett Johansson) is the beautiful assistant of both Angier and Borden. She loves both of them, but she has a much more meatier part than I am telling. I won't elaborate more on the plot than this, as it will be more amazing to see it without knowing anything about it.Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale play off each other perfectly and the period setting of the movie is beautiful. Except for the Batman movies, this was the first time I saw Bale in any other character and I loved his portrayal of Borden. (I skipped Terminator 4 as my friends said it was bad). Every actor performs amazingly and this was a film which I loved as the plot takes so many beautiful turns and twists, all done in a believable way (except, Tesla's machine, which won't give a shock to humans). The film also has three acts, the ending which they show at the beginning is elaborated further in the real climax. This film flows forward like a calm river which has a fall coming. It was really beautiful and poetic in many ways. The cinematography is excellent, the background score is also beautiful and the sets look very authentic. I didn't root for any one character, as both of them are flawed and no one's an upstanding man. They have their own beliefs and different methods to achieve them, but I didn't root for one, I cared for both. The ending is quite shocking and pleasing as well. If you still haven't watched this, please don't let this gem of a film pass you by. If there is a choice to see three films before I die, this will definitely be one of them.10/10

I love nolan movies it just give you the different type of story for movies

Depicting the story of two magicians, who develop a rivalry that eventually turns out into a true war, "The Prestige" is a movie that keeps you connected all throughout its two hours. Some people said about it that sometimes the action tends to be boring, but I consider exactly the opposite: I didn't have the time to get bored, due to the very well-written story. The actors are amazing: Hugh Jackman - charming yet sometimes scary, as we know him, and Christan Bale, more lively but equally "strong" as in Batman Begins, are the two rival magicians. Their act is sustained by Michael Caine, as their mentor, and Scarlett Johansson. I didn't go to this movie expecting much, but after having seen it, I can say without any doubt that this is one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time, and I strongly recommend it. It's a film to savor and to feel (and eventually maybe to love)!

Sometimes I think movies are losing their magic. Over the years I have learned so much about the movie making process -- about how stunts and special effects are done -- that movies just don't amaze me quite as much any more. It takes a movie made with remarkable skill to make me forget the process that goes on behind the scenes to make the movie magic believable.To a great degree I suppose that is also true of magic as a performing art. The levitation trick or the sawing-a-woman-in-half bit may be eye-popping to one as a child, but eventually the magic of magic comes from learning the secret of the trick. The irony, of course, is that learning the secret usually destroys the magic. Knowledge is the natural enemy of illusion and magic (cinematic or sleight of hand) can only dazzle if it is so skillfully performed that the technique outweighs the mechanics. In short, achieving the "Wow!" before facing the question of "How?" THE PRESTIGE understands this, and yet it doesn't. It is, for most of the way, a flamboyant display of magician's showmanship, yet it builds up to a revelation of "How?" which comes off as something of a cheat. When the film gets around to revealing the secrets of its tricks, the reality seems far less credible than the illusion of supernatural power. The fake reality of illusion is explained with an even faker illusion of reality.The film deals with two turn-of-the-century London magicians whose rivalry as competing showmen is fueled by ever-escalating acts of revenge. They strive to not just top each other as performing artists, but to sabotage each other as hated enemies. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale play the competing wizards (Robert "The Great Danton" Angier and Alfred "The Professor" Borden), who form an emotional juggling act, constantly tossing back and forth the roles of villain and victim. Like a magical coin, sympathy for either man disappears and reappears at unexpected intervals. Likewise, director Christopher Nolan keeps all of his balls in the air, telling the story with flashbacks within flashbacks in a way that is not nearly as confusing as it could have been. All in all, a very intriguing concept for a movie.Unfortunately, the filmmakers become would-be escape artists and place their film and the two protagonist into traps from which they can't seem to logically escape. Both magicians focus their attention on "The Transported Man" trick, which would appear to require the trickster to be in two places at once. But after promising not one, but two elaborate answers to how they did it, the film builds to a pair of shaggy dog endings, neither of which play fair with the audience. Alfred's secret seems so obvious in retrospect that viewers should have complete permission to slap themselves on their collective forehead for not seeing it coming a mile away. But the film cheats; revealing the secret early on by denying it as a possibility.On the other hand, Angier's secret takes a totally unconvincing sci-fi twist that not only doesn't play fair with the concept of magic as the art of illusion, but also defies the basic laws of physics. The story doesn't just cheat, it tries to change the trick in the middle of the performance. You don't leave the film feeling amazed; you leave feeling vaguely insulted, like the master illusionist has played you for a chump.Though lacking in humor (a vital distraction in creating illusion), THE PRESTIGE is a grandly played stunt, full of craftsmanship, showmanship and style. But it is like watching a magician who promises to produce a tiger out of thin air, but can only conjure up a kitten. The result isn't either "Wow!" or "How?" but "Huh?"

'Prestige' starts as Jules Verne and ends as Star Trek on a bad day.Atrocious acting: Ever heard of 'Mummerset? It's the word used to describe the ridiculous accent that actors use to indicate they're from the English countryside, the sort of 'ooh-arr' sound that Robert Newton makes in 'Captain Blood'. In 'The Prestige', the ridiculous accent used is 'Mockney', the one actors use to sledgehammer that they're from London. Luckily for Michael Caine, he was born an East Londoner, but the rest of the troupe in this pile of tripe look and sound like they're auditioning for 'Eastenders' (a dreadful UK soap), trying to out-gorblimey each other. Caine does his usual reliable turn as the worldly-wise buddy who's powerless to stop things going wrong, as seen in 'The Man Who Would Be King'. And go wrong they do. When David Bowie is the actor giving the best performance in your movie, you're in trouble. The interchangeable cardboard magician's girl assistants do not manage the transition from TV acting to big screen at all. Caine once did a TV 'masterclass' about screen acting, the upshot being that you shouldn't blink in closeup - note how all the other actors fail to observe this rule, and it shows Caine was right.Preposterous plot: The movie opens with the death of Jackman, where Bale is on Death Row for his murder, and is told partially in flashback to when Bale and Jackman are rival magicians. Bale, for some reason he can't remember, contrived to cause Jackman's wife to die in a trick, so that naturally Jackman is obsessed with revenge. He's also obsessed with discovering the secret of Bale's 'Transported Man' trick, where the magician instantaneously moves from one side of the stage to another. Now at this point, about an hour in, I thought I'd guessed the ending. Jackman has to hire a double in order to pull off Bale's transportation trick; the only problem is that he ends the show beneath the stage while the drunken, stroppy double gets all the applause. (Somewhere along the way, Jackman acquires a wooden leg, which appears overnight, but doesn't seem to inconvenience him beyond a slight limp). Of course, I thought - Jackman eventually gets the double to perform the 'Pledge and Turn' (the opening premise of the trick), so that the double is the one who gets drowned in the tank placed below stage by Bale. I was wrong. We are eventually asked to switch from a reasonably atmospheric period melodrama (think 'The First Great Train Robbery') to schoolboy science fiction. Jackman, at vast expense of which we get no explanation, buys a cloning machine - yes, a cloning machine - from real-life distinguished inventor Nikola Tesla (Bowie). Every time he performs the trick, Jackman dies and is cloned back to life, in the traditional 'Star Trek' transportation manner. What? WHAT? Just as well Tesla's machine didn't work, or he'd be back to give Christopher Nolan a piece of his mind. Sadly not a joke: if 'Prestige' were even just a little tongue-in-cheek or camp, you might be able to feel that your intelligence was not being not just insulted but placed in the stocks and pelted with rotten vegetables, ordure, and pseudo-science as seen in ads for hair conditioner. No, 'Prestige' is deadly serious about itself as a history lesson and as a drama. Starting as Edgar Allen Poe meets Jules Verne, it ends up as Doctor Who meets Star Trek, and it's a train wreck. A terrible film.

If you have some IQ and haven't watched this movie yet, don't.At the beginning everyone believes that this movie is going to be brilliant and all the tricks of those magic will be explained. But no, in the end the script writer and director just slap on your face: This is a sci-fi movie you idiot! That replicator machine ruined all the suspension the movie has built in the first 2 hours. All the tricks suddenly become so cheap.It could have been much better if Angier cooperates with that double man and drown him in the end to frame Borden up. But instead, the director got you some alien or terminator machine to replicate 100 Angiers.I registered an account on IMDb just to give this movie one star. You can see how disappointed and angry i am .

this has has to one the best movies ever if not the best..Christopher Nolan is a genius..there is no flaw in the movie..the direction is excellent..Christian bale and Hugh Jackman have put in Oscar winning performances..the plot is mind blowing.. the movie is centered around two magicians with a contrast idea of what magic is and the two are driven by intense rivalry towards each other..each tries to outdo the other and even try to sabotage each others performance..in the end one becomes obsessed to learn the secret of the other's trick and he is willing to risk everything to obtain it.. the movie is filled with twists and binds the viewer.. all i can say is its a must watch..

If all you read are some of the other comments here, you might think  "The Prestige" is a cheat and a disappointment. And maybe if you are  watching it with a superficial mindset, it is. But if you really pay  attention, and delve into the many layers of story, you will see the  movie as so much better than that.  Two magicians rival to be the best, and this movie takes you through  many years of that rivalry, along with the resulting jealousy, anger,  betrayal, and ethic and moral dilemma. Oh, and did I mention death,  disfigurement, and deception? The performances are gripping, and the  production is stunning, creating a believable setting that draws you  into the story. I did experience some moments of confusion when the  time lines jumped into the past or present a bit abruptly. But in the  end, most questions will be answered. It's important to remember,  though, that the most compelling question is not what was real and what  was deception, but rather, how far do you allow yourself to go to prove  you're the best?

Christopher Nolan's "The Prestige" is a very good looking movie and is very well acted. That having been said Chris Nolan plants so many winks toward the audience and little hints everywhere so that the "not so average" movie goer could see where it is leading one hour into the film. I did and so I am greatly disappointed.If "The Prestige" carries such an elaborate plot, with many twists and turns and a touch of sci-fi to it (no spoiler warning needed, it is mentioned in the commercial) then why make it simple for audiences to follow it? Movies like this carry great weight with terrific work and craftsmanship but for the second hour I sat in the theater knowing the end.This is not really a review, seeing that I don't need to review this film after hundreds have already done, but it is simply that if you follow the film properly (by listening to what the characters say without taking everything literally and by seeing everything that you are indeed seeing) its payoff will be quite sub-par.I compare this to "The Illusionist" because both films attempt to pull off a con on the audience. "The Illusionist" carries more grace, in its almost 1920's film-making style, and the plot is harder to figure out but overall it carries realism, which "The Prestige" does not (by a long shot).5/10 due to a terribly predictable story that is purposely woven in that fashion by Chris Nolan. If you want to see film that is airtight and what ill awe you, watch his film "Following".D.

The movie had a great set-up and very good direction and story telling... however the ending was completely awful. The duplication machine was beyond ridiclous for a movie with a serious tone. Its as if the writers, during the screenplay, ran out with ideas on how to end the movie and explain how "The teleportation man" trick actually works... so instead just decided to make a fantasy ending/ explanation. However, as with all christopher Nolan movies, the movie is paced very well with a lot of realistic twists and turns. the story telling (up until the last 10 minutes) is very good. However, the main problem is the two big twists. The teleportation machine was previously discussed. The other was the ridoclous plot twist of the twin brother. It is obivous the writers reached too much to create a magic trick they couldn't logically explain themselves so they created the twin, and added a sprinkle of hints throughout the movie to attempt to give crediablity to the awful ending

Maybe I'm still bitter, because I was hoping to see a dark tale about evil magicians and, possibly, some wizardry. Instead, what I got was an overdrawn, dragged out costume flick that gave away all of its suspense way too early. Anybody, who can't figure this film out within a half hour needs to get off the Xanax and stop daydreaming. I knew from the start that there was no way that Batman killed Wolverine, at least not the way he was being accused. Like the movie repeatedly asks "are you watching?", all the answers are given quite early. When Borden's wife makes the assertion that some days he loves her and others he doesn't, that alone tells you there is another. I know I'll probably be ripped to shreds for my opinion on this film, but it's mine and I'll stick to it. And for god's sake what was Scarlett Johansson even doing here. Don't get me wrong, I love Scarlett, she's a great talent, but every scene she was in dragged, she looked like she would rather be somewhere else the whole time. I assume she and Jessica Biel have both sworn off magicians for life. The one thing I really enjoyed in this film? David Bowie. The man still has a presence that musicians and actors of today would kill for. One last thing? Was Edison really such an evil bastard that he would destroy any competition that came? I'll have to look into it.

Christopher Nolan is an undeniably great filmmaker and every movie of his I've seen I'd give at least a 7......that doesn't mean everything he does should be on the IMDb top 250, let alone this high up! I feel like everybody rates Christopher Nolan's films a 10 simply because he directed them. It irritates me to see movies such as this and Interstellar so high up on this list when (although they're both fine movies) there are so many other (in my opinion) objectively better films that deserve those slots. I pretty much only wrote this to complain about the inflated scores on most of Nolan's films, but I'll talk briefly about the film. The acting was very good and the presentation was nice but nothing spectacular. There aren't many specifics for me to complain about besides the ending, which is why this review has a spoiler warning. The ending makes the film contradict itself. Basically it turns out Christian Bale was playing a pair of identical twin brothers the whole time. Hugh Jackman gets Christian Bale hanged, only to get shot by Bale's twin. His twin was the reason he was able to perform the teleporting man stunt so seamlessly. This goes against the whole philosophy Bale's character was preaching! Its stated multiple times that the reason Bale could perform the trick so seamlessly was because unlike Jackman, he supposedly wasn't using a doppelganger. But then at the end it turns out he WAS using a doppelganger the whole time! JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE AN IDENTICAL TWIN DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE THE SAME PERSON! YOU'RE TWO DISCRETE ENTITIES! YOUR CLAIM IS A LIE!In essence, the rest of the film is great but the stupid ending tarnishes the experience as a whole.

I much preferred 'The Illusionist', as that film at least had likable characters a viewer could hope would prevail, in the end. I've seen 'The Prestige' twice, now, and I think even less of it after the 2nd viewing than I did after the first. But, people seem to really identify more, these days, with characters that have no redeeming moral values, and are driven by their dark obsessions to the point of whatever-it-takes. A totally sad, sick, unsatisfying ending.Others have said that one has to have intelligence, and a healthy attention span to enjoy this movie, and I would also add to that, a true interest in magic, and how it works. Though the real 'meat' of the film lay in the personalities, I felt they were suffocated by layers of intricate plot weavery of how the tricks were accomplished, and if you aren't interested in that? this can be a very long watch. I have endured, rather than enjoyed.

The truly amazing thing about this movie is that it has managed to fool nearly its entire audience into misinterpreting it, even though the clues it leaves behind are so numerous and apparent as to make the solution to the movie absolutely obvious. It makes a fool out of its own audience.The movie succeeds in tricking the audience into believing the machine is a cloning device, while actually being something else entirely. The true secrets are never revealed to the audience yet it believes it has an adequate solution. That is part of the brilliance of the movie. It tries to make a fool of the audience in general and succeeds.Im sure there are a few keen minds that truly understand what the machine does and are skeptical that Fallon is really Borden's twin, but the audience in general is duped into accepting faithfully what it's told. The movie never reveals its secret but the audience still feels the plot is resolved.It manages to paradoxically resolve the plot for the audience while not resolving it at the same time. It successfully sells them an alternate solution that isn't accurate and leaves them completely oblivious to the real solution. But they don't mind, because like the closing line says, the people watching "want to be fooled."

I totally enjoyed this film from beginning to end. The acting, costumes, and locations were superb. Funny, the only other movie I've enjoyed as much this year was "The Illusionist". (Pick a card, any card....) I've always been interested in the life and times of Nikola Tesla. This movie was a great tribute to this misunderstood, brilliant scientist. Yes, just like time-travel scenarios, this film makes you think but not enough to give you a brain cramp. It's twists and turns rival the most demanding road rally track and will keep you involved the whole time. Not too many films do that for me anymore. It's a terrific way to spend 130 minutes. Be sure to have plenty of popcorn on hand.

I've found this to be one of Nolans most entertaining and rewatchable movies. Two magicians start out as friends but develop a dangerous rivalry. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both phenomenal, amazing performances and a believable rivalry. The pacing is flawless, every scene and beat hits brilliantly and makes this a great and entertaining experience. The supporting cast all deliver, Nolan still can't write women, Bowie, Caine and Serkis pick up the slack easily. Whilst Nolan has become much more of a High concept director, often with stunning set pieces, with this he tells a basic story, with plenty of genuinely unexpected twists and stylish direction and cinematography. This shows the brilliant storytelling, which Nolan has mastered.

I almost gave this film a 10, but for me, 10s are reserved for absolutely flawless film with perfect execution. I would have to go over this film with a fine tooth comb to confirm that fact, which it very well might, but I can definitely saddle it with a solid 9.I remember seeing this when I was 17 on a road trip to New Orleans to catch a cruise, and I remember being blown away by the ending. After a handful of rewatches, this film still holds its weight. I have seen almost every Nolan film, except Memento, Dunkirk, and Tenet, which is only because I haven't gotten around to it yet. I started following his work closely after the Dark Knight trilogy, Inception, and The Prestige. That said, I actually would contend this is Nolan's true masterpiece, over Inception and Interstellar.Here is why. The story of the film grabs you. You have two young magicians who are colleagues at one point, but Angier's wife is killed when Borden defies their mentor's advice, tying a potentially dangerous knot during a deadly trick. Tragedy strikes, and a bitter feud is born.The two duel each through sabotage, espionage, and one-upmanship. The feud gains momentum and intensity over the course of the film until tragedy strikes again and another person dies, or do they?The cast's performance is excellent with great chemistry. Particularly, I give Hugh Jackman a nod for his downward spiral into villainy, though other reviewers have stated Nolan structures the film where there is no clear hero or villain. I disagree. While this isn't a film of heroes and villains, one character clearly goes too far while the other discerns the line between what's worth dying for and what isn't.From a production standpoint, it was intriguing to watch the tricks planned and played out throughout the course of the film. Furthermore, the film has been said to be a parallel of sorts to the rivalry between Tesla and Edison, which could explain the nod to them near the end.The story-telling is where I say this is Nolan's true masterpiece. He literally explains the film in the first five minutes. At multiple points in the film, he explicitly gives the answer away, go ahead rewatch it and see.To name a few:
Cutter's explains the mechanics of a magic trickAngier explains the fishbowl trick to his wife.The little boy discerns the disappearing bird trick asking, "What happened to his BROTHER?"The consistent use of the bird cage trick (think Angier's line "Nobody cares about the man in the box.")Borden's diary speaks of two people, at face value the audience would think it's referring to Borden and Angier, but Borden wouldn't have known Angier in that part of his life. So, he isn't referring to Angier but his brother.The title of the film itself is called The Prestige, which is the third act of a magic trick, the act of bringing something back. The film itself is one big trick you see ordinary men who make themselves disappear in some capacity and then reappear by the end of the film. Both men "die" to come back later. Borden's character whispers to the guard before his execution "Are you watching closely" and then "Abracadabra" before being hung. Cutter himself says in the beginning of the film you aren't really looking for the trick, which is a good wink from Nolan to the audience. This is because you aren't looking for what is clearly directly in front of you.I have to give a round of applause for this kind of writing. Truly well done. Great use of misdirection.I have always enjoyed Nolan, even when I wasn't jazzed about Interstellar, he managed to surprise me. But The Prestige is arguably if not his greatest work then one of the greatest.

I just can't explain. You have to see for yourself how Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale has acted

Such a great movie. Sometimes I wish that I could erase it from my memory so I can watch again and again by being fascinated by it.

Nolan has dropped the obsessive stage magicians fiction of back in 19C London an absolutely stunning way.Exquisite supporting characters and props are delivering the fiction more believable. The Prestige shows the genius way to develop characters in a critical situation. The Prestige is the most entertaining but masterpiece of magician film of all time.

Play The Prestige! It is fast and easy to view! A good way to spend your time. Be the best!

My Rating : 8/10Does Christopher Nolan ever put a foot wrong? This is miraculous! The Prestige easily is a solid 8/10 for me. Great film for repeated viewings with a brilliantly paced narrative and brilliant acting from all the leads.It's a Chris Nolan movie. Go watch it!

I have watched more than 2000 movies in my life
This is the best one ever , sometimes words can not describe the beauty of this movie

Christopher Priest's novel is given a class A film treatment here. With Jonathan Nolan and Christopher Nolan's top notch screenplay, and Christopher's Directing talents, this film comes off very well.Michael Caines Cutter character is good and his being the narrator is even better. Hugh Jackman as Robert Angier, and Christian Bale as Alfred Borden, the feuding magic men, and Scarlett Johanssons role as Olivia, the woman assistant between them are well acted roles.Magic and deception are the keys to the plot. There is a little romance but the key elements here are the feud between the men, who will stop at nothing to outwit each other.In the beginning, one lovely lady assistant dies as the result of a mistake by one of these guys when they are doing a joint act. After that, they split up because the dead woman was a wife of one of them. Then the rivalry begins.They claw each other until the death trying to find out each others secrets. This all takes place in the late 19th century, and the settings for this are magnificent. There are 3 elements to each magic act, and the final curtain is the Prestige, where the audience gets something they do not expect.In the case of this film, you have to watch the end of it to get what the movie viewer does not expect. It is very much worth watching. Very good film making here and the Nolans would go on to do Inception later on. This is a solid effort that shows how they got to the later film.

The whole movie is a massive magic trick and it deserves a second viewing just to comprehend the whole thing, which seems to be a constant thing regarding Nolan's movies.The movie is about two magicians (Bale and Jackman) who compete with each other as to who has the best trick, escalating to insanely extreme situations. Bale's biggest trick for example was that he had a twin brother and they swapped places the whole time! The twins went as far as cutting one's finger to match his twin brother. This was pretty awesome, especially if you know that real life magicians have gone to similar lengths. James Randy for example used to carry a piece of paper in his pocket for years. That piece of paper had "today's" date on it, saying that "today I will die". If he had a fatal accident, would you believe that he predicted his own death or that he wrote a piece of paper each day for years?! Talking about devotion! The movie explores that devotion and the sacrifices someone must do to deceive others. But the greatest deception of the movie was fooling the audience itself! The movie is very realistic but the explanation about the cloning machine was not something I could accept, so I looked around to see what other people thought about the ending. In my research pretty much everyone was agreeing with the explanation given, that Tesla gave Jackman a cloning machine, and Jackman in his every act kills one of his clones (or dies himself). That's pretty awesome and the audience bought it. But it's a lie nobody really saw! Michael Cain gives the secret 10 minutes before the end. Earlier he told a story about a sailor but he reveals now that the story was a lie. This is a hint that Jackman's story was also a lie, and Bale and the audience bought it.Cain tells the audience in the end that you don't want to know what happened, you want to be fooled. So what happened? Over the course of the movie, many bad things happen. Bale kills Jackman's wife and Jackman shoots Bale's fingers. Bale takes Johansson to his side, manipulates Root (Jackman's double) and humiliates Jackman on stage while braking his leg. Jackman kidnaps and buries Bale's friend to blackmail him for his secret. The secret was planned and Bale sends Jackman to a wild goose chase to America. There, Tesla fools Jackman with some hats and some cats to get away with the money.Jackman returns the favor by giving a fake diary to the imprisoned Bale. Everything regarding Tesla's machine, is only known from Jackman's diary. And knowing that Bale lied in his diary, then surely Jackman lied in his as well.So to wrap this up. Jackman was obsessed to find Bale's secret and it was only revealed to him in his last breath. The Tesla story was a lie and the machine never worked (that would be completely unrealistic, even for Tesla), but Jackman used it in his favor. Jackman used and killed Root to frame Bale. Bale dies, but his twin brother takes revenge by shooting Jackman.Almost perfect score because it fooled almost everyone!

I'm going to be specific. For God's shake, this movie captivated my attention since the very first image, the very first line. Every scene, every second of this wonderful movie is a stoned masterpiece that no one ever will top. The prove that this is the most stunning mind- blowing epic movie ever made is that after watching it for first, or second or third time (whatever), you try to understand the puzzle for a week. I seriously want to cry, because of this film, I will never watch something better. Thank you, Nolan. Long live the king.

I'd never even heard of this movie when it was shown on TV and only decided to give it a watch after I read that Michael Caine and David Bowie were in the cast.I was immediately caught up in the story line, which is almost totally believable, considering the function of the Tesla machine this is no mean feat of writing and acting. It was totally engaging from start to finish.The scene where a young boy starts crying because he believes a canary has been killed is a massive clue to the whole mystery, which is revealed right at the end. This is one movie that I am looking forward to seeing again, it's not often one says that.

Which is saying something because The Usual Suspects is in my top ten movies of all time. I felt the same way watching The Prestige as that film. It has a real mystery, who-dun-it, who is Keyser Soze feel to it. I would be surprised if other Suspects fans didn't love this movie as much as I did.The first wonderful thing about it is that you have two of the most talented and charismatic actors of their generation playing against each other. I really love this match up and they both brought it. It's probably Hugh Jackman's best role so far. Christian Bale has had a more impressive resume so of course he's great here. But I thought they really complemented each other.The story itself is great. It's about two magicians competing against one another with vendettas intact. Great stuff. An interesting thing for me was the parallel of dueling real life magicians Nicola Tesla and Thomas Edison. It was just a little touch but I thought that was pretty cool. Anyway, once the rivalry really gets going it wraps around itself so many times that it pulls you in tight. I do admit to having figured it out before the end, but instead of feeling cheated as events unfolded the way I hoped they would, I just got more jazzed. I actually had unconvinced myself of one of my guesses only to have it turn out to be true which is the same thing I did with the identity of Keyser Soze. That's probably why I'm so reminded of that movie.I think that The Prestige is better than most of the Oscar nominees for Best Picture this year. I think the costume design is the best I've seen lately. Christopher Nolan hasn't done anything wrong yet. And I do think this is his best film.I actually have forgotten what the rating is for this film but I would recommend for most people over 10, who enjoy magic and mystery and great film-making.

This movie is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen... The actors - mostly Bale, Jackman and Cane - are great. The storyline is well designed. Brilliant movie!!!Of course I have some questions... (SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!)Does Borden (played by Christian Bale) really have a twin brother, or it was also a clone?? It makes no sense to make "TESLA" the keyword for his diary, unless he had some connection to Tesla. And if he had, it's possible that he also tried the teleportation machine... and cloned himself. The only difference between Borden and Angier (played by Hugh Jackman) is that Angier really wants to be teleported, while using a double is enough for Borden. So after Angier teleports himself, he always has to kill his clone...Tough movie... I have to see it again and again... :-)

All I really want to say is that Christopher Nolan is The King of the little details in modern cinema. And the mixture of talent and perfectionism in this film/guy is close to frightening. So watch very very close (to be read as: "Watch the movie AT LEAST one more time") and you will be deeply and utterly rewarded. Another thing is the brilliant cast. Kudos to everyone involved but the three big names are these of Caine, Bale and Jackman (in that order). Phenomenaly presented witty screenplay, with unexpected twists and some really fresh humour. But make no mistake, this is not a comedy, the jokes will only make you feel a little bit more cosy. What you will also experience is a masterly Nolan-blend between reality and mysticism.Thousand thumbs up for a genius at play! 10/10

The name of the movie. It says it all. Its a classic movie. Its pure class. I was spellbound by the flawless direction. The screenplay is perfect. The music, the background, the story. It was all so well knit together. Kudos to the director. I was not a big fan of either Christan bale or Hugh Jakcman..But, that has changed. These two go about their business like they are thorough professionals. I wish the movie had done better. Its a strongly recommended movie for anyone. WOW..WHAT A MOVIE!! I just had to say it again..one of my ALL TIME FAVS. I did go to see it with no expectation. I was contemplating watching another movie since I had not heard enough about this one. But, I am glad my friends came up with the idea to see this one. I paid 10 bucks to see it since it was an upperclass theater. But, I am not complaining at all. Would have paid a lot more to see it..GO watch it before any other movie..

Cutter (Michael Caine) - Every great magic trick consists of three acts. The first act is called "The Pledge"; The magician shows you something ordinary, but of course... it probably isn't. The second act is called "The Turn"; The magician makes his ordinary something do something extraordinary. Now if you're looking for the secret... you won't find it, that's why there's a third act called, "The Prestige"; this is the part with the twists and turns, where lives hang in the balance, and you see something shocking you've never seen before.How fitting then that these three acts are exactly what Christopher Nolan presents his audience with in his latest masterpiece "The Prestige." I imagine it must be difficult for critics of Nolan's work to read reviews composed by others where terms like "masterpiece" are substituted for plebeian words such as "movie" or "film." However the simple fact of the matter is that Nolan has a gift for making movies and "The Prestige" is no exception.Nolan's latest work centers on two rival magicians who set out to steal the secrets of one another's work after a series of unfortunate events have unfolded. But it's not just Nolan who made the film, it was also the cast. Christian Bale continues to reinforce the idea that he is one of the most dedicated and versatile actors of our time. This guy's rise to the top is simply an example of "hard work pays off." He plays his character so well that at times you love him and at others you pity him. The same can be said about Hugh Jackman who goes beyond playing a "mutant with claws." Of course nothing needs to be said of the great Michael Caine but the performance I was most surprised with was that of Scarlet Johansson's. She's come a long way from playing the squeaky and somewhat whiny clone in Michael Bay's "The Island" and succeeded in this movie by passing herself off as both a bright and cheery maiden and a scorned assistant. The characters themselves stand in a sort of gray area. No one is truly good or truly evil. There is no black and white. This coincided with the idea of "living the act" whereby one of the characters suggests that a true magician is always a magician. On the street, in his home, in front of a crowd or on his own. He must live his entire life as his stage persona if he desires to fool everyone during a performance and with that we are kept guessing as to who the protagonist and antagonist are. "Never reveal your secrets" he says "or they'll never respect you again." *Spoilers* I must admit that this film was much darker than I had anticipated. For some reason I felt like the previews led me to believe that I'd be dazzled by magic tricks when in fact the majority of the tricks performed are interfered with by the two on screen rivals. The first words that came to mind when we were presented with a few "truths" behind the tricks of certain magicians were gritty and shocking. We get a first hand look at how magicians were and are often forced to "get their hands dirty" in order to get the standing ovation they seek. This brutal honesty was an effective device employed by Nolan that helped to keep you guessing if they were "going to do that again" as the characters made preparations for their next round of tricks. The film itself is also very thematic often examining the juxtaposition of a pair of concepts. Inventing versus stealing, magic versus science etc..Cinematographywise enough good things can't be said. The scene where Jackman is standing amidst a field of light bulbs was eye popping and the sets themselves are very convincing. However the most effective trick Nolan has up his sleeve is his signature "flash of memory" shots where as a character speaks of the past we get quick glimpses via rapid flashbacks. Nolan also has a knack for telling stories by placing key plot points out of chronological order and he really pulled out all the stops here. Smart moviegoers may pick up a few things here or there before they are revealed but the entire story is kept well shrouded until the very end.And what an ending it was. Considering all the praise I've given this film you're probably thinking to yourself "then why a 9 and not a 10?" Well for starters this movie was a tad drawn out. This minor gripe coupled with one other thing are the only complaints I had and that one complaint was the supernatural angle no one saw coming. I won't go so far as to spoil it completely with specifics, but let's just say that there's a point in the film when the theme of slight of hand versus wizardry or stage magic versus science is meant to be taken literally. This is the film's make or break angle. Once the secret is revealed will you still respect the magician (Nolan) and his trick (The Prestige)? Nolan seems to think so. The ending is great in that it's conclusive or open depending upon your interpretation of the events which have taken place on screen. It is what you make it out to be. It is VERY rare that such an ending exists but the final moments of "The Prestige" are a testament to how conclusions such as these should be pulled off. According to the film "A real magician tries to invent something new, that other magicians are gonna scratch their heads over." In my opinion the same should ring true for directors and that's certainly the case with "The Prestige." 9/10

WOW! It's been a long time since we've seen a decent film that excels in almost all aspects. Direction, Cinematography, Editing, Acting, to name a few, were all just amazing. Then again after Memento and Batman Begins...could we've expected anything less from ace director Christopher Nolan. The Prestige keeps you guessing throughout the movie and alternates the role of 'good guy' and 'bad guy' between the two protagonists with such subtlety that by the end you're not biased to one or the other character, rather, you understand where each of them is coming from. A strong story and good acting by both Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman make this film even more gripping. Scarlet Johanssen puts in her two cents...but is overshadowed by the male leads. I must say...one of the best films I've seen! 10/10

I have long been a fan of Christopher Nolan's Memento and Batman Begins, so I was expecting very much from this film. Not only were my expectations met, they were surpassed. The genius of this film tied in with the subtle nuances of cinematography and signature Nolanisms (voice overs) created a masterful work truly worthy of the title The Prestige. Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Andy Serkis, David Bowie and Scarlett Johansson all performed wonderfully with each actor fully melded with their on-screen persona. Once again Nolan is a master of time and he uses this to a great advantage in a similar fashion to Memento. Without a doubt, this movie is recommended with two thumbs way up. Missing this spectacle would be very unfortunate.

A film about illusion and trickery needs to be resolved with illusion and trickery... not with sci-fi.The fact that Angiers couldn't just ask Cutter to look and identify what type of knot Borden/Fallon had tied should have been warning that we shouldn't buy into this film.... and the big wait for a non-cheating, sensical twist was not rewarded.

Are you seeing closely? Nolan's consistent non-linear narrative and cross-cutting did not destroy the sense of substitution of Deadly Magic, and in the end it will never be able to see the clues buried by Nolan. Nolan's film also wants to challenge the audience's thinking like magic.
What you see is notreal. Maybe you sometimes think that you have seen the truth, but you can't bear and imagine the price of success! Are you willing to make such a sacrifice? Are you really looking at it?

*NON-SPOILER*This film is on another level of incredible, everything is almost perfect in every way. From the storyline, to the actors, to the acting, to the journey you are taken on, this is a film I have seen almost a dozen times already and it won't stop there!
At the time of release it was most certainly underplayed.
This film will have people talking about their own interpretation of it and over the years I've read a lot of opinions. I'm pretty sure I've got the whole plot and specifics down to a tee, however, I won't be letting on to any spoilers on here!

Christopher Nolan has yet again proved that he is one of the greatest movie directors of all time but I think this might just be his best work.I couldn't find a single flaw in the movie. I tried to nitpick was much as I could but I just couldn't. The movie hot do good that I literally started laughing by how good the film truly was. This film is a must for any film lover and don't miss out on this perfection.

Every time I watch this film, it gets better. Every time I watch it, I have a different point of view. Every time I watch it, I discover something new about it.Christopher Nolan at his best. Jackman, Serkis and Bowie were great, Bale was absolutely phenomenal. In my opinion, it was one of the best single best performances of all time. Sometimes with my favourite movies, I wish we could just erase part of the memory and watch it "fresh" again.... but The Prestige only gets better. When you watching the movie for the second time knowing the ending, you can focus on details. Bale's performance goes above 10/10. Nolan's directing goes above 10/10.One of my favourite movies of all time. If you reading this after seeing this movie once and you liked it - watch it again. Trust me.

This is Nolan's masterpiece. Equally as brilliant in its structure to Memento and equally emotional to the Dark Knight. Christian Bale puts on an acting clinic. Nolan flips everything on its head with the non-linear storytelling and perfectly lines up the story's secrets to be revealed. The story is structured just like a magic trick. Nolan reveals a normal rivalry. He then shows something peculiar about the rivalry, a murder. Then Nolan brings the character back in the prestige. He does this not once but twice! He does it so cleverly that the audience does not know what has happened till its already over. Possibly the greatest twist in cinematic history!

Got to be the best Christopher Nolan movie I've seen. Had me going right to the very end. If his next movie TENET is anything like it I'll be one happy movie goer.

This is the best movie i've ever watched
Everything is good about it
I love it

What a masterpiece of cinema, of Christopher Nolan's best films.The performances, cinematography, direction, and script in this film are some of the best I have seen in 21st century cinema.10/10

After watched this movie and still 420, I ask many question why this movie is goddamn good
But I suddenly realized that is really simple
Is a movie from Christopher Nolan, is MY MAN

Thanks to the cast of this great film, hand in hand, thank you to Mr. Nolan for making this masterpiece really one of the best I have ever watched, so much fun!
The magician shows you something, then seizes it, and finally reappears, and his art is reappearing, not sequestrating.

This is one of my favourite films.
It is full of twists and turns and ends in an unexpected way.
No matter how many times i watch the prestige i pick up on something new hidden within the story.This is an amazing film that will get you thinking and wondering about how it is done.

Honestly, this film is one of the most complex characters out of all of Christopher Nolan's films. Really thought provoking. Full of twists. Great performances by Bale and Jackman.

Screenplay , story telling and characterisation . nolan at his best . twist after twist . must watch movie for movie lovers

amazing movie you have to watch it to the last second i never get bored during this film they show the reality of the magic with an entertainment and some adventure through it with an excellent cast you need to keep thinking for the first 90 minutes what is happening?! and how it happens?! you will start to understand everything in the last five minutes and see how everything is so easily even if your mind complicate it!!!!

The Prestige is significantly brilliant. From the tense acting to the beautiful directing, all the aspects exceed my expectations. Christopher Nolan (Batman Begins, Memento and The Dark Knight) continues to pursue brilliance. And quite literally has reached it. All of his films are of such perfection that no other director that i can think of could ever come close. His efforts in creating The Dark Knight for example are beyond anything i have ever seen before.Christian Bale (American Phyco) and Huge Jackman (X-Men)both play rival magicians. But when Alfred (Bale) performs the ultimate magic trick, his former friend turned enemy Robert (Jackman)tries to find the secret in the trick. Each twist and trick leaves the audience wanting more and when the credits roll you would feel like this film is deserving need of the best picture Oscar. And quite rightly so.

i just saw this movie last night and let me tell you, this movie had me guessing the whole time because usually you could predict the plot of the move but not this time,twist over twist over twist... this is one of the few movies ever made the keep on shocking you, also the ending is probably better than any movie from 2000-present and no lie. some people say that there is no hero but once you see this movie, you will understand because greed, pride and obsession are the key factors so if you miss the movies that have a bang for your buck, this is will no doubt leave you wanting more action-10/10 plot-10/10 effects/visuals-10/10 overall- best movie in last 10 years (no lie)

i'll keep this shorti loved it, i knew i it would be great simply from the cast and the director. i wasn't expecting it to be quite this dark but i loved every minute of it and was happy it was done this way. Nolen does a great job of setting up the ending of this movie to keep you guessing how it would be done. I guessed some of it but was surprised by other parts. I thought Andy Serkis and David Bowe were great. After seeing it at the late showing i had trouble sleeping b/c i was still trying to replay the movie in my mind to understand all the twists and turns.Great Movie, a must see

What can I say, wow! I almost missed this movie in theaters. I looked at number of reviews and got a sense that this movie is about obsessed magician revivals, and how important professional life to those who care. Yesterday, while rearranging my Netflix queue I noticed to my surprise that movie is one of 250 best rated movies. So after short research I found one theater where movie was still playing. Movie certainly was worth the effort. It is somewhat similar to "Usual Suspects", but better since, I can much easily associate myself with magician then with criminal. I tracked at least three nested stories, it has absolutely unexpected ending, and movie is very logical if you analyze it afterward. Scarlett Johansson acting was average but other actors just took me there. I believed every word. If you can still catch it in a theater, go, and if not happy DVD viewing.

Too full of the current fashion: flash-backs, flash-forwards, twists, and turns. The main point of them in this case seems to be to confuse people. Well, guess what, I was confused, but that didn't stop me from figuring out the BIG SURPRISE that Borden had a twin about halfway thru the movie. here's an example of those giving it a "10": "Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman give out powerful performances. I can imagine no other actors to portray these characters." Whenever someone says that about actors in a movie, you know they cannot think outside the cranium, never mind outside the box. And here is more "The film also features a solid performance of David Bowie, playing an expert in electricity." Whoa. This film expert never even heard of Nikola Tesla. Hey film school dropout, he is a real person. Whether he built the first transporter/cloner/whatever, well, we'll leave you to think about that. What? Don't they offer "Physics for Dumbies" in film school?

Fans of truly great bad acting, crushed birds, bogus history, boredom, bogus science, preening smugness and amateur amputation -- this idiotic flimflam is for you.And if you thought mining or bridge-building was a dangerous game around 1899, think again. Stage magic was apparently fatal or, at last, crippling for nearly everyone involved -- especially if you were an assistant or a canary. Might have been a sound move to avoid using blind (I am not making this up) stagehands. Playing tricks on the audience is as old as film -- perhaps the medium itself should be seen as one big trick -- but this is so clunkily done and so much is signalled in advance (just one example of many -- closeup of rope, medium shot of distraught woman, closeup of rope again, then, abracadabra, silhouette shot of human pendulum -- and watch out for anyone with a limp and of being hit over the head by repeated, blatant examples of duality).Except for Caine, Serkis (maybe) and the feline Bowie, the performers of these very unlikeable characters are cringingly inept with Hugh Jackman taking the marzipan for playing multiple roles so astoundingly badly that you wonder if he thinks great acting consists of SHOUTING while crying and, possibly, having your nose run (or was that yet another tear?). After all, I suppose, if you can't be childishly histrionic at your own wife's funeral, what's the point of turning up? And as the out-of-work actor (if only!) Jackman seems to be doing an outrageous send-up of Robert Newton (not known for his own under-playing, I think). If the idea of such cardboard cutout characters battling over who is the greater not-very-inspired magician seems a bit thin, well, you might be on to something -- at more than two hours this is wildly overlong as well as overwrought. It is also a bit hard to care who wins the "duel" (or how) if you think each is a boring, revolting, homicidal creep. Even the magic business is supposed to be entertaining from time to time but these guys aren't just magicians, they're psychics and so know all about tricks like Sawing a Woman in Half which, as Chris Priest knows, was invented by an illusionist called Selbit and not performed until 1921. (According to the author the dueling magicians' story ends in 1903.)And where does the sadomasochism come from? With all the gloating over gore, violent death and grime, you'd think Mel "Mad Monk" Gibson had had a bloody hand in this. Yet all this grimness is so very silly -- no sense of period; no sense of the theatre or of how magicians actually work; no point of view; no sense of time (which does, probably, have a kind of inexorable reality); above all, not a trace of irony or humour (though some in the audience I was in laughed when one of the ridiculous Hugh Jackman characters fell down). I suppose, though, it is rather comical if the great (offstage) villain is Thomas Edison -- in fact, he may be the Moriarty here, the Napoleon of Crime -- let's hear it for direct current.There may be an interesting movie to be made about the business of magic in the late 19th Century theatre -- but this is definitely not it. It's a typical Hollywood mess which says nothing new, makes not a whole lot of sense and assumes (perhaps correctly) that the audience is a pack of clods. The novel (as usual) makes more sense than the movie which is (as usual) the mucked-up, dumbed-down version of part of the story. While you can't set a whole novel on film (though there have been some interesting attempts) you don't need to turn it into some sort of crazy, inept pantomime set in a mortuary.Many of the changes/"improvements" are inexplicable -- why, for example, is Rupert Angier now Robert? Murdoch-phobia?? Some are crudely for US consumption -- you try putting a pre-decimal English penny in a pistol and see how far you get!And it's full of unsubtle tricksiness such as "AB" (Alfred Borden) "RA" (Robert Angier) "C" (Cutter - no first name? Like Sabu or Paladin?) and for all I know there may be a "DA" "BR" "A" lurking somewhere - but by now who cares? This is the sort of thing that seems clever to people who don't get out too much. Perhaps someone could re-edit this dreary rubbish to transform it into a real movie; cutting out (or dubbing with a human voice) any character mugged by Mr Jackman might be an excellent starting point.But I would much rather have listened to Cutter talking the illusion business over with Tesla -- especially on precisely how you deal with the blood and the noise when you smash a live bird on a table top or how you can produce all that Tesla lightning without deafening performers and audience with Tesla thunder.Is The Illusionist any better?

I'll keep this short and to the point: The Prestige is an interesting story with pretty decent acting, but could have been much better were a little more thought put into post-production. Both Bale and Jackman played their parts quite well, but the flip-flopping of scenes between past and present were ambiguous at best and nearly every twist was foreseeable (if not obvious) long before it was discovered by the characters. For a movie about two magicians I would've expected the ending to reveal a secret I wasn't anticipating the entire second half, which for obvious reasons made the last hour drag on waiting for the inevitable. In short, wait for the DVD. It certainly isn't worth paying $10 at the theater, for the acting is decent but not outstanding, the magic marginal, and the eventual revealing fairly obvious. It is less a matter of "who and how" and more a matter of "when" they'll finally tell you what you've suspected since the first 45 minutes.

Memento was much worse than this, but The Prestige is empty and nonsensical in equal measure. At what point did the two brothers decide, 'Crikey, we ought to give up this brothers lark and hide ourselves from the world so we can pull off the Transported Man trick'? When they were still kids? And who thought it was a good idea to cast David Bowie as the Serbian lord of alternating current? If you like movies with two preposterous twists -- it's not just the twin brothers who are so dedicated to their art that they'd chop off their fingers and sleep with each other's girlfriends, but A MACHINE THAT ACTUALLY TELEPORTS PEOPLE ACROSS VARYING BUT QUITE SHORT DISTANCES!! -- then this is definitely for you.One thing I've learned is that, if ever you chance upon the diary or journal of your nemesis, make sure you read from the back to the front. You have been warned!

This is a very good example of Hollywood spending a lot of money on stars and directors to try to make a great, deep movie, and failing. The "art style" editing, cutting scenes back and forth in time, trying to make the story, cut up, seem deeper than it is.Why is he in Denver, where is Tesla, why is Scarlet Johannsen even in this movie, who cares about the surprise ending (and who believes it?)?? These are all good questions that we scarcely care about. Just looking at my watch waiting for it to end.The actors are good, but you actually need an interesting story to tell. A similar period (Sherlock Holmes' London) is done much better with the Downey/Law flic just out. For this one, don't see it in a theater, don't pay to rent it, maybe watch it if someone lends you a copy or you are huge Hugh Jackman fan, otherwise, save your energy.

I just saw this movie and did have a good time watching it. I never felt bored with it even though it was a bit long. My wife loved it and I can see how some people would. It was pretty well put together, good acting, & a few good special effects. It did keep you guessing...almost too much. By the end of the movie I was wondering what the next 'twist' would be. Some of them you saw coming, some were not so obvious but it was apparent that the author of this story was trying to keep you guessing about the nature of good and evil and made it difficult to pick out who was good and who was bad. My only true gripe with the movie was the second act. After reading a review of the book I found that I wasn't alone on this. Some people will let it pass and just enjoy the movie but I couldn't. The movie takes a drastic turn to the super-natural (even though they half heartedly try to explain it as inexplicable science). Normally I wouldn't be put off by science-fiction or magic or whatever but this movie started off like it was based in reality and then just changed. If they could have created a plot device that would serve the same purpose as Hugh Jackman's ultimate trick without the super-natural I probably would have enjoyed it more. I think most people will enjoy this and if you're interested you shouldn't avoid it because of my comments. It was still a well done movie, it just isn't for everyone.

This movie was a moderate disappointment to me. From the beginning, it jumped back and forth in time, making it unnecessarily difficult to follow, and largely spoiling any potential to maintain a sense of suspense. This became very annoying after a while.The thing that I found most annoying, was the movie revealed its one surprise, pretty early on, and then kept waving it in front of the viewers' eyes again and again. To the extent that it was at all difficult to predict the gist of the outcome well in advance, that was only because the jumping back and forth made it a little difficult to assemble the pieces in the proper sequence.At the end, they did the obligatory sequence to explain to the audience what had happened, but by then, I was so tired of the anticipation for that obligatory moment, and so annoyed by the number of times that they had already revealed the "surprise", that it was annoying. I am confident that almost everyone in the audience had similarly figured it out, although most of them probably weren't as annoyed by it as I was.The only real surprise in this movie was David Bowie's performance. Not that it was a great role, but it was surprising to see David Bowie in this role at all, and he played it for all it was worth.This movie is being grossly overrated by the IMDb membership. It's probably worth the cost of a DVD rental, but there are much better movies to spend your money on at the theater.SPOLER ALERT: For anyone who is unable to figure out what I am talking about: from the moment that Borden appeared magically in Sarah's apartment, the story gave away the fact that he had a twin. That happened early on in the movie. The movie is about tricks and illusions, not about magic, so there is no way that anyone watching the movie could not have realized right then and there that Borden had a twin.The pieces of information that were spoon fed to the audience, could potentially be explained by either of two alternative theories. One was that Tesla had previously made the same machine for Borden, in which case Borden's twin was the product of that machine. The other potential explanation is that Borden had a twin all along. For a brief period at about the middle of the movie, it isn't apparent which of these possible explanations is correct, but the only reason why you are uncertain for even that brief period, is because the effect of chopping up the story is that you don't have all the information. But as soon as you are allowed to see just a teeny bit more of the missing pieces, you realize that Borden did not have a similar machine, and that if he had, he certainly would not have sent his rival on a quest to procure a similar machine. Hence, you are left trying to figure out where Borden's twin had been hiding up until the point when Borden starts performing the transported man trick. Even worse, you are left trying to ignore the sheer absurdity with what remains: Borden had sent his rival on a wild goose chase across the Atlantic ocean to visit Tesla in the Rocky Mountains, and by coincidence, Tesla happens to know how to make a transporter machine! "The Prestige" is a silly, second-rate story told in a confusing, chopped up manner, in order to confuse the audience, and to make it seem as though there was more to the story than there actually was. Will audiences ever wise up to this sort of chicanery?

No words it's just simply awesome I loved it a lot I can watch it over and over again

In this movie about rival magicians in the turn of the century, the real magic is not found in the character's shows, but in the plot twists that director Christopher Nolan comes up with. Throughout the whole movie, the audience is taken on a blind roller coaster ride of things no one saw coming, yet somehow Nolan makes it work to where everything makes sense in the end. Along with great mystery that always keeps everyone guessing how the puzzle pieces of the movie fit together, the detailed cinematography of the secret behind early magic and interesting historic fiction of Nikola Tesla versus Thomas Edison add to the traction the film has with the audience. You will be left blown away at the brilliance behind this masterpiece and be craving more when it is over and done.When the first scene opens, the "ingeniuer" John Cutter explains the three parts of a magic trick; "the pledge," "the turn," and "the prestige." These three components run how the movie plays out, unfolding as sort of a magic trick inside of a movie about magic. Robert Angier and Alfred Borden play two embittered magicians, sabotaging each other's magic performances ever since Borden inadvertently killed Angier's wife while she was performing a water escape routine. Angier realizes Borden has a better trick than he when he unveils "The Transporting Man," a trick in which he teleports between two cabinets. So the struggle of trying to outdo him as a magician turns this once harmless art (or "the pledge") into an obsession for Angier. The dark turn Angier takes in trying to be better makes the audiences lose what sympathy they had for him after losing his wife. Nolan turns the once protagonist into the antagonist as Angier begins to try and ruin Borden's life, including his family.Angier spends countless dollars and travels around the world looking for a way to beat Borden's trick. His travels lead him to Nikola Tesla, a non fictional character who was an inventor in the U.S. Angier convinces Tesla to build him a machine which has an unknown affect on Angier. The film does well in keeping the purpose behind the machine secret, hinting at what it does, but never really telling you. This adds to the secrecy of what is truly going on in the movie, with what the audience seeing only scratching the surface of what is really going on. As Angier descends more into his mania, Borden is frustrated that Angier has come up with a much better transporting trick than his own, goes to investigate Angier's secret. What he finds is when Angier steps into the machine, he falls into a locked water box and drowns; Borden is convicted of Angier's death and is sentenced to death. But, in another turn of events, Angier is revealed to be alive, taking Borden's daughter into his own custody. This leaves no more feelings of kindness towards Angier as he lets an innocent man hang and takes his daughter. It is revealed that Tesla's machine makes exact copies of people, which Angier has killed every night after his show in the water box. Borden is hanged, becoming "the turn" as he seems to disappear from Angier's problems. At this point the movie should be over, Angier has won and taken his malicious revenge, but it doesn't end. No, Nolan decides to break out "the prestige," filling the audience with gasps and having their jaws hit the floor as Borden returns and shoots Angier. Throughout the entire movie, Borden has had a twin brother who has switched places with him with the other turning into Borden's assistant. The entire motion picture has been two plots at once, an amazing showmanship of mystique of the behalf of the director.The Prestige is a wonderfully dark movie of deception, obsession, and revenge. All of these things mixed with the secrets of magic make the entire film a trick, a mind game that twists the watcher's imagination. In the end, the audience in both the movie and those watching the movie are fooled into thinking things could be so simple.

I think this is one of the all time best movies. I just happened to see it recently after I saw the first two of the Batman trilogy to understand the third, after I saw what Christopher Nolan had done with the Batman Trilogy! To remember each detail, to connect it so exquisitely, to utilize each character so perfectly, to show vengeance and yet to show humanity through vengeance and to create the sitting-on- the-edge-of-the-seat experience, is an act of genius. Be it the main stars Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, the ever-brilliant Michael Caine, Rebecca Hall, Scarlet Johansson, and Piper Perabo or be it somebody like David Bowie or Andy Serkis, the utilization of the role and portrayal of emotions be it anger, love, joy, intimacy or humanity is brilliantly crafted. Each twist is beautifully crafted delving into the details but not over doing. Although the story constantly switches between present and the past, the viewer is never lost as Christopher Nolan puts it all together so exceptionally well. The entire movie is built around the cool, composed but wizard-type portrayal of Christian Bale vs a 'plagiaristic' Hugh Jackman with the pure obsession of being the best and to do it the villainous way. Too bad that nobody won Oscar for this movie. But 2006 had some really classic movies. The Prestige is a must-watch!

The movie is astonishingly good. It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time guessing what was behind this "Transported Man" trick. I had my own guess, but it turns out I was fooled along with others. The plot is very sophisticated, almost flawless and with the appropriately woven science-fiction scenes. 19th century London being on the edge of new "electrified" era was shown perfectly well, all the costumes matched the time, as well as the exteriors. The actors did a good job depicting their characters, especially I would like to point out the performance of Christian Bale. The movie is fully complete, doesn't require a sequel. Such movies are a very rare thing and are definitely must-watch!10 out of 10!

Despite the similarities and the release timing, this movie is very different from "The Illusionist" in that it is more of a character study into very obsessive individuals as well as an adventurous, exciting and intriguing example of what film-makers can achieve if they really try.The performances are outstanding, the storyline complex enough to keep you guessing till the end. There are some really quite clever plot twists and surprises.Im happy to say that I didn't "work it out" until the various revelations.Very well made and thoroughly enjoyable; a thinking persons film.

There seems to be a strongly defined split in posters' opinions about this movie. On the one hand, there are those who didn't see the two big story twists coming and thought the film was the best of 2006. Then there are those who did see the twists coming and felt cheated, just like audience who booed Bale's Chinese ring magic early in the film. One poster went so far as to say that because THE SIXTH SENSE kept him guessing then all came together but he didn't like the way the ending of THE PRESTIGE had to be explained by the narration, then the latter film somehow failed.I fall into the "Didn't see the twists coming" category (whereas I knew Bruce Willis was a ghost pretty much straight away in SIXTH SENSE).I'm afraid I didn't figure out Christian Bale's secret until it was pointed out at the climax of the film, though I did have an inkling of how Hugh Jackman's Tesla machine worked (the clue was in the hats and cats)But none of this matters. The real value of a movie is not the same as the value of a magic trick. Even if the film is ABOUT magic tricks. A film doesn't fail only because you figure out the twist ending. The journey is every bit as important as the destination. (And then there's films that DON'T have twist endings at all - are they automatically bad?) I know how the special effects are done in STAR WARS - doesn't spoil my enjoyment of the film one jot!No - in my opinion THE PRESTIGE is an ingenious examination of the obsession magic generates in its adherents where the entire film is a metaphor for the nature of performance magic.And it has TWO great twist endings. Surely, that should satisfy anyone?

I watched this movie and not only was I totally surprised with the ending it kept me thinking about it over and over. This movie is without a doubt something to remember, something to shock you and something to keep you wondering. Not only does this movie show you an amazing story it keeps you wondering what side to pick and it makes you change sides over and over. At the end who was wrong and who was right? You be the judge while watching this movie. Great actors, great story, beautiful and very detailed scenery, a bit of history, a bit of drama and everything else you'd desire from a movie. Enjoy this movie and be sure to recommend it.

A wonderful movie with a twist to beat all twists . . . everything I'd expect from the Nolans. I swear, I audibly gasped in the theater when the final reveal happened.Christian Bale is amazing and believable, and although I'm not usually a Hugh Jackman fan, I was even impressed with his performance. Creepy and dark, this movie is one of those films you just can pay close enough attention to--I can't imagine anyone having it figured out before the movie lets you in on its secret. I think that "The Illusionist" stole some of this film's thunder, and it's a shame--that film was nowhere near the masterpiece that this film is. I am waiting for this film to come out on DVD, just so I can watch it a few more times, being able to (hopefully) listen to the Nolans' commentary track.

A very different setting, a very different story of the art of magic and illusions makes the movie a classic. Bale and Jackman fight it out for the top spot in the theatrical worlds of magic and trickery. And they weave a spell of magic doing so. i was spellbound in the entire movie, drawn into making hypothesis of how each trick was being performed, and they managed to trick me every step of the way. Both actors are geniuses and deliver a powerful presence on-screen. The dialogs are good, performances great but what makes the flick stand apart from the rest is the imaginative storyline that made me sit the entire movie, moth agape. In the end, when the truth is revealed, one is left speechless. words don't do justice to the film. A must see for all. A slow movie, but that adds to the beauty of it. A definite 9/10.

this movie is excellent... the story is outstanding and the plot full of twists, yet there are plenty of perfectly fitting clues during the movie... acting is good too and the late 19th century setting is detailed and intriguing...While undoubtedly entertaining "the prestige" gives you a chance to think about the endless conflict between lies and truth or fiction and reality, stage roles and real life managing at the same time not to judge the characters and leaving to the audience the freedom to decide where good and evil (if any) stand...a "must see" for everyone, thought it would be wise to note that during the movie appear a few scenes that while not truly violent might be quite upsetting for a young public...

It's been a long time since a movie has captured my interest the way that The Prestige does. The prestige is a movie that intelligently motivates the viewers to keep guessing a simple and yet complicated answer. Like ALL of the most "INCREDIBLE" magic tricks ever to be performed there is somewhat of a disappointing secret, but nonetheless if you can keep the audience from ever discovering this secret, they'll never be disappointed. A lot of reviewers will say, the tricks weren't that impressive as if the answer was so obvious but I can bet that until things were made REAL clear those review critics would have never guessed it either. There was no real spoiler in this comment, but if you go and watch the movie after reading what I said about there being a very simple answer to the ultimate trick, you should be able to figure it out even though you might doubt yourself at the beginning. Still, you WON'T be DISAPPOINTED!!

Robert Angier and Alfred Borden have worked together since stage hands. Both wish to be the grandest magician, creating tricks that the world has never seen. Their friendship goes sour after Angier's wife, Julia, dies during 'the drowning woman' trick. Angier continues to build his act with craftsman Cutter, a designer for the illusions. Borden tries to crown himself as the greatest magician, yet lacks the style to drawn an audience. Borden and Angier's rivalry thickens after Borden performs the greatest trick 'The Transported Man'. Obsessed to know his secret, Angier is consumed to discover Borden's method.Angier is a showman. Style, grace and charm are his weapons. A magician relies on miss direction to fool us all. Angier is his own miss direction. His showman ship out reaches his craft, knowing his limitations and playing to that strength. After his wife death, revenge is his only driving force. He doesn't want to be the greatest magician, Angier wants Borden to know he will always be better than him, with no restraint to his conquest. Borden is no showman. Lacks pizazz and style, unable to make the simplest of tricks seem unreal to the audience. His hubris strains his progression, over confident in himself; but with reason. 'The Transported Man' is the greatest illusion beheld by any magician, he finally makes the simplest trick into the grandest of all; no wonder Angier becomes consumed with figuring out the method. They are each others opposite and equal, their antithesis. Their rivalry isn't one of brawn nor of words; they don't talk much after Julia's death. Their fights are of the mind, psychologically and game of wits to sabotage the other.Obsession and identity crisis is deeply explored through out The Prestige. Stated by Cutter, you can't be afraid to get your hands dirty. Though this is not about the death of a little bird for the sake of a trick, lives are torn and destroyed over two mens bitterness. Obsessed with each other, Angier and Borden's original identities are unrecognisable, with those they hold dear holding the brunt of each ones torture. The real magician of this act is director Christopher Nolan. Like a magician, Nolan draws us in nice and close. Cinematography by Wally Pfister, our view of the periodic time is confined and constricted. Our surroundings are blinded by whats happening. Smoke and mirrors, miss direction utilising the non linear time sequence, confuse us from what we are meant too see. Nolan is gifted with his craft as a film maker, playing with the audience. Offering his pledge, creating the turn, then the prestige of the final act, where the revelation finally emerges.Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale as Angier and Borden respectively, are both amazing. Jackman greatly evolves with Angier from a man of craft, to a man torn of revenge and obsession. Bale perfectly shows Borden torn between his love and his love of magic. Michael Caine shows his talent and perfect as Cutter. David Bowie is a real stand out in his minor role as Tesla. Scarlett Johansson wraps beauty and talent nicely.The Prestige is one film that is simple magic. Another mile stone from Nolan.

I went to this movie not completely sure what to expect. I knew it was directed by Christopher Nolan (Memento, Batman Begins) and starred Christian Bale (Batman Begins, American Psycho), Hugh Jackman (X-Men 1, 2, and 3), and Michael Caine (Batman Begins). I knew it was about magicians. I knew it looked cool as hell. This movie blew away all expectations. The acting was first rate and the direction, par for Christopher Nolan, was superb. This movie will definitely exercise your mind with more twists and turns than all of M. Night's combined. The quest for fame and one-upping a rival becomes an obsession that makes for a riveting piece of entertainment. Only Christopher Nolan could undertake such a complicated storyline and deliver it so perfectly. Definitely worth the seven bucks and two hours spent.

How so many people can like a film with such a low quality of writing is beyond me. I am about to tear the film apart. If you have not seen this film, please stop reading now. The film has very good sets and the acting is well done. I cannot complain about either of these two aspects of the film. All actors are top notch. My big beef is with the logic of the storyline. The film starts off with a murder. Hugh Jackman is found drowned in a water tank after falling into it through a trap door from the stage above. Hugh Jackman is copying a magic trick that is done by Christian Bale does with his twin brother who is always disguised and no one knows he has a twin. Later, you find out Hugh Jackman finds a scientist named Tesela who created a machine that can create doubles of anything, but it teleports it nearby. Hugh Jackman uses the machine to make a copy of himself, has a trapdoor that falls into a watertank and drowns the copy on the stage and comes out from wherever it teleports him. His arch nemesis Christian Bale is framed for murdering Hugh Jackman and one of the twin is hung. That's basically it. Now, the tear apart begins. Is the secret twin is just ridiculous. He's going to spend years and years and years, dressing up and hiding his twin, just for one lame magic trick that didn't even do too well? Next, His twin brother is about to be hung and he STILL doesn't come forward and say he's a twin to clear his name. Plus, they were both with the same woman and she didn't know? Next, Hugh Jackman finds out he can clone himself. Bale can pull off his trick with just his brother. Couldn't Jackman just make like two copies of himself and do the trick even better? No, the dumb ass drowns himself every time for some reason. With two copies of yourself, you don't NEED to drown yourself. Not to mention, Jackman could make copies of gold or money, and he never does. Instead, the guy drowns himself over and over again because "He's not sure who the original is and who is the clone." I'm pretty sure the dude that materialized out of thin air is the clone. It's totally unbelievable.

I was told by several people things like "This movie is awesome!" and "you'll have to watch it like three times to figure out what happened!" Well, I can pretty comfortably state that the movie is not "awesome" and it only took about 1/2 the movie to figure out what was going to happen. I'm not quite sure why such talent agreed to be in this film after reading the script, unless they figured that most Americans are dolts and wouldn't realize how inane this movie actually is (which apparently is true). If you do watch it, and I don't advise against it because it's a better alternative than a lot of other movies, don't be surprised if you come away shocked not at the ending but at the way it comes about. For in this movie, I'm not blown away by the twist but rather by the ludicrous yet horribly predictable road leading to it.

I don't like horror films, but these days, most thrillers tend to be packaged as horror films, so I was pleasantly surprised to see the commercials for the Prestige when it first came out. I didn't get to see it then. Too much going on, and more important movies to see when I did go to the theatre.I have to say, after waiting so long, I'm glad I didn't. I'm very underwhelmed by it.Hugh Jackman was a bit stiff in this, and that makes me worry, because I know he can pull off good acting. The rest of the performances were generally lovely, though.The flow was a bit confusing at first, but not overly so, and as time went on, everything was set in its proper time frame. But I do think people who like linear films would have difficulty with the first hour or so of the film.The sequences with Tesla felt like they should have been in a different story. Something more action-oriented. They didn't fit with the flow of the rest, really, and were only there for the big shocker, and to give Bowie his cameo. I would much rather have seen a growing thread of mishaps and attacks from each of them as Angier worked out the secret.The ending left me cold, and to be honest, rather ill. I think the writer sold himself short. Or thought they were writing an episode of Twilight Zone.Borden's secret was obvious less than halfway through the movie or so, and while it did seem as though at times they might have been working towards another explanation, in the end, it turned out to be just what it seemed.All in all, a vaguely interesting story if you're into stage magicians, or are fond of the actors involved, but not at all what it could have been, given the right attention.

I'd been excited about seeing THE PRESTIGE, especially as it re-teamed two of my favourite film people from BATMAN BEGINS: the usually excellent Christopher Nolan, who delivered the excellent INSOMNIA and MEMENTO, and Christian Bale, an actor who can do no wrong in my eyes. Then what a shame it is that THE PRESTIGE turns out to be nothing more than a silly, muddled science fiction film masquerading as a serious and engaging drama.It starts off on a strong footing, with interesting characters and situations, but quickly loses these in a stupid plot that jumps all over the place and never bothers making much sense. The biggest kick in the teeth, however, is the ending, which ties things up with two plot twists that are frankly awful. The first is a sci-fi staple – cloning. What place does it have in a supposedly realistic Victorian thriller? It just turns this film into a fantasy and loses audience interest. The second twist is the one that's apparent early on, and one of the classic 'tricks' much beloved by writers of murder mysteries and crime thrillers. It's also been done to death and was outdated about a century ago, but no, it's resurrected here and had me groaning, feeling cheated when it appeared.THE PRESTIGE isn't a totally bad film and there are quite a few things to recommend it. It looks fantastic, and all of the electric special effects are tremendous. It also boasts a pretty good cast, with Christian Bale delivering another outlandish performance – his Cockney accent here is quite amusing – and Michael Caine presiding over things in his usual manner. Hugh Jackman I don't particularly like as an actor, and he's at best passable here; but in comparison to the hopeless Scarlett Johansson, who struggles with her British accent, he's Laurence Olivier! There are some fun minor roles for Andy Serkis and David Bowie, the latter playing the inventor Nikola Tesla and doing a good job of it. While the magic acts and tricks are engaging when they're on screen, it's just a shame that the film becomes so implausible and cops out towards the end. THE PRESTIGE contains nothing I'll want to sit through again.

Magician Alfred Borden is on trial for the murder of fellow magician Robert Angier, allegedly by positioning a lockable tank of water below a trap door that Angier fell as part of a trick. With the prosecution pushing for the death sentence, Cutter, experienced mentor to both men, relates the history between the two men. Starting as friends working as plants to support an established magician, their friendship turns into professional rivalry at first but a tragic accident sees the two enter a personal battle.Like everyone else, I want to be liked. I want people to think good of me and perhaps respect me; I don't think it is an unnatural thing and, no matter what they say, most people feel the same. However I have never pandered in my opinion to the majority voice and the IMDb's ridiculous "was this comment useful" voting system will not deter me from questioning why this film is so highly thought of. On one level I can see why because it is a masterful piece of story-telling that weaves flashbacks within flashbacks as easily as moving between concurrent scenes set in the present (whenever that is in regards the narrative). In doing this it doesn't produce confusion as to when we are but rather makes the story much stronger and deeper. Nor did I have a problem with the sci-fi ideas being put into Victoria times; no, although the "cloning" machine is a jump, it is only a jump because my head is stuck in the period and not accepting such an idea as I would in another film.No, the problem I had with it was the build up to an ending that I had to spend a lot of time thinking about. I didn't think so much because I didn't get it  I thought about it because I didn't think it would be so straightforward (in sci-fi terms of course) and predictable. The boards are full of debate over whether the machine works or not, but I think that the reason for this is that many are keen to find a twist and trick that isn't really there. This was a letdown for me and the delivery of the final scenes suggested that I should be taking it as a twist or surprise, but really it isn't. To me this stops it being as good as everyone else seems to think it is, but I still can see the strengths that kept it interesting for two hours.As said the story-telling is very strong, even if the conclusion isn't all I would have liked. Visual themes (clues?) are run throughout the film in a way that isn't clear until after the plot becomes clear. Ahead of this stuff though, is an engaging story in regards the characters, which was what drove the majority of the film for me. The flashback structure compliments the narrative well and produces characters sucked under by envy, hate, bitterness. With this to work with both Jackman and Bale give strong performances that really drew the script out and made this aspect so interesting to me. Caine is a class-act as he often can be but some of the other casting is questionable. Serkis I have no problem with in a minor role, but Bowie is always a risky prospect (see Fire Walk With Me for proof  or rather lack of proof since he was cut down to a minimum to the detriment of the film). Here he isn't terrible but he certainly isn't any good. Johansson I'm not sure about as an actress. She is pretty as a young woman but her acting isn't always up to scratch and here she is pretty average at best.Overall then, not as brilliant as everyone would have you believe because the conclusion is nowhere near as strong (or surprising) as the delivery and build-up within the film would suggest (far less the gushing praise and theorising herein). The manner of telling is masterful though and works so well that perhaps it accounts for my problems late in the game. The lead pair respond well to this, both turning in very strong performances. A very good film then, just not as wonderful and flawless as the praise on this site would have you believe.

It's the longest movie I've ever sit through, it felt like 9 or 10  hours at least. Nothing interesting happens, it's a story so convoluted  and stupid written only to get to the last "shocking reveal" that  ANYONE with half a brain would expect coming since the introduction  Caine gives about a magic trick. I wonder just how can Hollywood  believe that people are still impressed or interested in this "usual  suspect" trickery: come up with something else already, we don't need  to be "fooled", we can take a good narrative that doesn't try to  outsmart us (specially when it doesn't like in the Prestige).  And then that reveal is even dumber than you could ever imagine, not  that you wouldn't see it coming at least 30 minutes ahead, it's just  that you would hope that it's not THAT stupid and that the  writer/director would respect the audience and give something credible  or at least smart. No luck with that.  Anybody that loves movies should stay away from this crap, I'm just  glad I didn't pay to see it, but I'm sad about wasting a couple of  hours of my time with it. Save yours, go see anything else, avoid at  all costs, it is worse than Al Quaeda.

Batman, Wolverine, Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson...What else could you ask for ?

This is seriously the best movie you will ever see. By far, both Hugh Jackmans and Christian Bales best ever performance.I was on the edge of by seat the whole time. It is a dark and mysterious movie that draws your attention and is very intriguing. It may appear hard to comprehend but the whole movie is tied together in the final chapter and it is at that moment when you truly realize what an amazing movie this is.Possibly the best Christopher Nolan movie yet!! He employs many disturbing and emotive scenes to highlight the instability of the human nature. This movie has gone way under the radar. This deserves to be up their with the very best and beyond.I am not a fan on the average movie that entails little action scenes or movies that appear to take time to unravel, but this blew me away. It gets into your head and messes around. I watched this and for 4 days it was all I can think about! an absolutely amazing art work.10 out of 10. Enjoy!

Those reviewers who give The Prestige low marks don't appreciate Christopher Nolan's talents and couldn't keep up mentally with the movie's direction. Christopher Nolan is indeed the best director in the mystery genre and creating wonderful plot twists with deep character development. The Prestige will keep you guessing from beginning towards the end. About 99.9% of movies that I watch, I guess at every turn what will happen but this movie will kept me wondering until the end... The acting is superb as Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are pitted against each other as rival magicians. I'm unable to see any other actors other than Bale and Jackman in the characters they played. Excellent casting with the rest of the supporting actors; Michael Caine, Scarlett, Bowie....Must see!

"The Prestige" is by far one of the best films I have seen in recent months. The actors pulled together a finely written script, and the directing was seamless. Many movies throw in "plot fillers" just to make up time or fill in some blank space due to lack of...something - but Christopher Nolan not only tied all the loose ends together, he threw in far more than normal and still managed to clean it up by the time the credits rolled. Yes, it makes you think, but it also makes you 'feel' the movie itself. Jackman and Bale played their roles to a "T" and I can't speak highly enough of them. And of course Michael Caine was brilliant. I've never been a big fan of Johansson, but I feel she really did pull this character from the pages of the script and make her real. Piper Parabo was also a fully dimensional character...a big step up from Violet Sanford. Two days later and this movie is still running through my mind in vivid images. Excellent.

Great plot! Great acting! And I guessed the secrets of the two main characters, but it was still entertaining to see the ending. The movie kept me guessing until the end.At first I thought that the male characters only used the female characters for their own advantaged-the two magicians pursue the other's secret tricks even after their wives die. But then I realized that they both loved their wives very much. The obsession still destroyed their lives, like the old man warned it would. Both are at the brink of death and we the audience are also left waiting to see what happens to them! I like not knowing more than the characters, it makes the plot so much more interesting and enticing!So worth watching. Now I want to read the book!

Another fall, another turn of the century tale of magicians. Seriously, why did we get "The Illusionist" and "The Prestige" in the same season? Don't confuse the two films, though. "The Illusionist" was a fun romp compared to director Christopher Nolan's ("Batman Begins," "Memento") take on showmanship, revenge, and evil. I would recommend not reading any more of my review if you want to be surprised by this impressive, haunting film.While "The Illusionist" was a movie about sleight of hand and good triumphing over evil via craftiness, "The Prestige" is a study of craftiness destroying. Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are magician's apprentices who both desire to someday be the greatest magician on the London stage. A tragedy early in the first act divides the men and leads to an escalating series of increasingly nasty and complicated revenge schemes.The two performers spend the film trying to one up and destroy the other. When Borden devises a trick that seemingly allows him to transport himself from one closed compartment to another, Angier becomes obsessed with trying to figure out the secret of "The Transporting Man." This leads him on a journey to Colorado Springs where he seeks the help of electricity wizard Nikola Tesla (David Bowie in a fantastic, subdued performance) and begins delving into actual magic/science. As Angier becomes more focused on destroying Borden, his friend and production engineer (Michael Caine) tries to temper his destructive impulses.The film uses a fascinating storytelling device that hops all over the place chronologically. Both men discover each other's diaries and this leads to a series of flashbacks upon flashbacks. Are the diaries reliable? Can we believe the stories they are telling us? As the film nears its conclusion, we keep waiting for the sleight of hand moment where we discover that the impending tragedy is just a device, a trick meant to enthrall and fool the audience. But Nolan is not Shymalan and he is crafting a genuine tragedy. No one gets out of this tale unscathed. It's a haunting film with fantastic performances and impeccable storytelling. It's a tragic epic that will alienate many audiences. They're gonna feel that they were owed a happy ending.For the more adventurous, though, this movie is worth the price of admission. For storytelling acumen alone, "The Prestige" is a must-see.

The Prestige was an incredibly deep and twisted film. The plot is fairly hard to follow and for I while I would think things like "is this the past or the present" but soon I realized that it didn't really matter what it was, because in the end everything comes together. The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat guessing, right up until the last seconds of the film. These last few seconds will make you say "Wow, I get it now" and you will realize that Innocent scenes earlier in the film have significant importance. The special effects are great and the acting is very well done. The movie draws many parallels with another recently released "magician" film - The Illusionist, but the action and intensity of The Prestige makes for a more exciting and enjoyable experience. A backstage view of how some magic tricks are done also adds to the enjoyment. Highly recommended, definitely worth the price of admission.

This was an unusual story, told and acted very well. It took me awhile (and I'm usually very quick) to see where it was going. Like the Illusionist it opens up many a moral dilemma for the audience. The cutting back and forth, at first, is a little hard to follow but then suddenly it becomes much easier and clearer as the movie slows down. The critics who thought that it was too slow in parts were wrong. It has to slow down in order to let the audience catch up. this movie allowed itself to be suspenseful, sad, funny and thought provoking all at the same time. It might not be Number #1 this week at the box office but it's interesting enough that people will go see if for week after week.

This movie is truly excellent. For some reason this website is full of negative comments on films. The people behind the writing and directing of this film are the same people that made Memento. The acting is superb. The twists are very well done. The trailers don't give away what the movie is about and you are kept on the edge of your seat until the final scene. If you have read any reviews from people that said that they couldn't follow the plot or are unsure as to what the true ending meant or anything to do with confusion in the plot they are people that need to go back and watch the movie again. This plot is very intelligent, but when you pay attention - the pay off is grand. Brilliant film making, I look forward to seeing this movie again. This is the best film I have seen this year and the fact that I feel so strong about it is why I came to this website to write about it.

I went to this movie with high hopes and high expectations. Being a magician myself I was a little wary that the director would not show the true life of a magician. I was not let down. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman were wonderful as magicians. Even the eccentric David Bowie was amazing as the scientist Tuslo. At the beginning of the movie we find that Christian Bale is being put on trial for the murder of his fellow magician Hugh Jackman. It then goes back in time and shows you the real reasons that Hugh Jackman and Christian were fighting. When Hugh's wife dies during an act I was very proud of the director. This event was like that of Harry Houdini who died after performing such a trick. If you love murder, a good story, and a good old fashioned rivalry I highly recommend this movie.

Acting and directing are subjective issues. Half the readers here are already rolling out the Academy Award red carpet for Nolan and Bale while the other half have set the phrase "cardboard carachters" as F buttons in their keyboards. The problem with this film is not the acting or the directing. Personally, I enjoyed both immensely. Alas, the movie is absolutely flawed by one and only one thing which I will call The Tesla fiasco. Only 6 or 7 reviewers out of 420 point out that this Deus ex machina is completely unacceptable for anyone who has not been in a coma for the last 100 years. Only two years ago, a verified teleportation of atoms took place, and mankind has a lot more to go before Dan Simmon's farcasters are built all over the universe. So, a teleporting/telecloning device (and a flexible one, cats, hats, magicians)existed in the 19th century? What a letdown. Now, magic has always trusted and followed science to produce better and more wonderful tricks. Real magic uses real science. So, the Tesla machine, since it is science should definitely be a magician's secret weapon. But it is not science of the 1890's. It may be science of the 2030's, who knows. If, by a cocmic coincidence I had met Nolan, let's say, 3 years ago, full of enthusiasm about adapting a not so successful book to the big screen, I would have given him only one advice : Don't go Victorian. Set the film in NOW. Shoot it in US. Seek locations where quantum teleportation experiments take place. It would be far more dramatic, far more believable, and it would give you the extra little something that attracts critics and audiences alike. You could have won the world with this one and all you had to lose would be the Victorian costumes.

It must be so long since there actually was a really good movie that people think this is a masterpiece. Nice to look at, well-acted, prominent cast, the welcome return of David Bowie, but too gimmicky to be a complete "masterpiece". Using the last 10 minutes or so to provide a series of lame explanations to attempt to redeem the integrity of this "epic" is not good enough. And is Scarlett Johansson trying to put all other young actresses out of work by appearing in a string of unmemorable parts in unmemorable movies? Hey Hollywood, give someone else a chance and save her for the next big movie where Josh Hartnett again attempts to justify "actor" as his occupation.

I am getting a bit annoyed with the IMDb ratings because they regularly trick me into watching bad movies which have inexplicably high scores.This movie is actually well packaged, technically competent, with good acting (except for the always wooden Jackman) and quite decent from a story-telling point of view. I was able to connect with the story and the characters despite their flaws and I was entertained for the first hour and a half.The process of getting behind the scenes and trying to understand/figure out all the subterfuges and tricks that these rival magicians use both in their acts and against each other was quite captivating and carried the movie well, the ultimate goal being to try to figure out "the transported man". Several of the twists caught me by surprise and I was waiting for a spectacular finale but then Nolan manages to drop the plot on the dung pile by unveiling... the Cloning Machine! The whole story becomes meaningless science fiction drivel. Why bring in a cloning machine when he could have borrowed a Transporter from the Star Trek set filming next door and wouldn't have needed to kill all those clones? And think of how all the other magic acts in the movie could have been enhanced with a Gravity Inverter, a Matter Replicator, Invisibility Cloak...Once the story credibility falls apart the nice packaging becomes an empty shell and it can't save the movie from demise. Too bad, it seemed to have great potential... Is Nolan becoming the next M Night Shyamalan?

Smarmy from front to back. All the principals are despicable. Nothing is visually interesting. The score is bad. It's slow talking, slow paced, slow to get ended. They could cut 45 minutes and omit nothing. Miserable lighting in most of the movie--feels like cavemen putting on a show. And why on earth would anyone pay the entrance fee when the light is too dim to see the magic. Magic isn't believe-able when it can't be seen. There is all too much of "it must be so because the movie says it is so" no matter how utterly preposterous it is in today's cinema -- Ocean's Eleven is another example.It's all in English but the deliveries are so bad that it is often impossible to make out what they are saying. Instead of shooting a scene again to get it right, they just write a repeat into the script so you can get it the second or third time it happens. Yuk---I want my money back. A Royal Nonesuch through and through.I can see why it is soooooo important to check the spoiler box on the review when the only reason to see a movie is to get a few moments of disgust at the end of the film when at long last the Scooby Doo moment finally slouches onto the screen. Please leave Scooby Doo to Scooby Doo -- he is so much better at it.

I think Maybe, because of all the positive reviews on this movie.I couldn't wait to see it.My wife didn't like it.To many twists for her to follow.I didn't like the heavy accents,at times hard to understand.I didn't think there was much magic either,not like the illusionist.I thought was so much better.We never knew why he would keep using someone that screwed him so much or the girl either? It didn't make a lot of sense and the ending was sorta dumb.The guy got hung for something he didn't do. Oh well goes to show you don't believe what you read.I think the emphases should have been more on the stealing of secrets which was OK,And a lot more magic.One minute they were dirt poor next minute rich?I didn't like the hurting aspect of the grudge.ruin each other OK,shooting one not so cool

Before I forget: Somebody said this was the best twisting movie since Fight Club. Honestly, must you make such a pointless comparison? Not only was Fight Club a hundred times better than this movie, the only thing it shares is the fact that people look like other people. Deal with it.I thought it could be a good movie - but then, of course, I watched it. This was a chance to make something great. It had good acting, famous actors, pretty cinematography and and a pretty neat premise about Tesla and his magic electricity/ duplication machine stuff. It failed, though, rather miserably. Now, it would have been a good movie, had it been muted, all the death and violent scenes, cut out, and simply been a showcase of interesting shots and pretty colors. And, of course, Tesla' cloning machine. In fact, the premise of the movie was pretty stupid. Seriously, there was no reason to make them magicians at all. Anybody can kill people, it just provides more interesting deaths if they can drown people in tanks or have people shot with their own guns. Take a hint from Pan's Labyrinth. Just grab the other guy and stab them in the face outright. It was confusing throughout. I eventually got it, but I had to pause the movie a few times. I'm not stupid, it was just so unexpectedly confusing I had to pause and think. Okay, so some guy called Angier drowns in a tank. The other guy, Bordon, goes to jail, and reads the dead guy's journal. The bits from the past switched between the dead guy reading the diary of the guy in jail, and the events leading up to him getting the diary. Both the past and present have a lot of unneeded jumping around all over the place, and in between all of that, the magicians end up hurting and killing a bunch of random people. They steal each others tricks, most notably the "Transporting Man trick". Eventually, Angier finishes reading Bordon's diary which ends with something like "I KNOW YOU HAVE THIS, I GAVE IT TO YOU ON PURPOSE. MWA!" As Bordon finishes reading Angier's diary, he gets a similar message. Finally, the movie confesses outright (although it hinted throughout) that Angier had created doubles that died every time, and as actually alive, (he most likely framed Bordon) and he steals Bordon's daughter for revenge and Bordon prepares to be hanged. Cutter refuses to let Bordon be hanged, but then doesn't care that Bordon (who had a double; one always posed as his agent. this is also how he did the transporting man trick.) gets the happy ending because he shot Angier, who made a ridiculous speech about how he never wanted Bordon's trick and just wanted to 'see the audiences' faces'. "OMG, they clap for me! Must kill more people!" After Bordon shot Angier, Cutter should have shot Bordon. Then they would have both gotten what they deserved. Except poor little girl would be all sad with no father. Cutter wouldn't want that.Oh yes, and one of the Bordon's loved Emily, their wife, and the other loved Olivia. Emily got mad because of the "affair", if you could even call it that, and so she hung herself. Rather stupid if you ask me.Speaking of the deaths, I thought the whole "Oh noes, Angier's wife is dead" thing to be idiotic. It started the whole stupid story. Throughout the whole movie, Bordon repeats "I don't know which knot I tied." Wow, I think you would, considering you specifically changed your frigging mind about what you were tying halfway through. I mean, seriously.What's wrong with you people? Get over it! I mean, seriously, you can't be that crazy obsessed, since the movie didn't mention the origin of this insane obsession. Oops. Never mind. Bad move, Nolan.The only reason this deserves a three is because of the actors, the cinematography, and the fact that it made me mad enough to slap everyone involved. Except David Bowie, because, in all honesty, the Tesla parts were all pretty cool in premise. They should have made the movie all about him. Three Cheers for "Tesla: The Movie".Was I really the only one who thought Scarlett looked a bit like Keira Knightley?

I liked this movie in that it's a nice story with interesting characters, beautiful imagery and decent actors. But like many other movies in the last years, this movie has a surprising plot twist at the end. In this movie I didn't particularly like it, and probably for two reasons. The first and main one is, the whole "plot twist" thing is getting rather old if you ask me. We've seen so many of these movies lately (The Sixth Sense, The Others, The Village, The Usual Suspects, Memento, The Illusionist, The Score, Unbreakable, etc. etc.) that it doesn't really impress anymore. Oh sure, it's nice to catch the viewers by surprise and say "Ha! You didn't see that coming, did you?" But then again, is it really that hard? In a world where the viewer is *expected* to "suspend his disbelief" and the writer has all the power to either show or not show information, you can make your viewers believe anything. In the beginning, or at least what was the beginning of this "genre" for me (The Sixth Sense, The Usual Suspects), it was still funny and unexpected. You felt tricked and kinda stupid when you learned the truth. But the more of these films you see, the more you realize how easy it is to surprise someone if you have absolute control over what information is or isn't shown. And, the more far-fetched the plot twists seem to get, which is the 2nd reason I wasn't really impressed by the ending of this film. It seems to have become a silly game among film makers much like the game in this film: a match to see who is best able to trick their audience, and who can come up with an even more insane plot twist. In this case it is insane indeed, or rather an insult the viewers intelligence if you want my opinion. Sure, just pull a proverbial bunny out of a hat by the end of the film like "Hey, what about THIS then eh?". Yeah, unexpected indeed, but cheap, really cheap. As someone else commented on this film: the makers seem to have worried more about delivering the best plot twist to date, than about making a good film, and executing the twist properly and credibly. Half way through the film, I was no longer really bothered by the issue that, at the end of the film, the plot twist appeared to offer a solution for. Part of this is because my "suspension of disbelief" had pushed the whole issue to the background. And part of it is because the film just doesn't keep you focused. There's so much other stuff going on that you aren't really sure what to look for. At a certain point I was waiting for unexpected answers when I didn't know what the question was.Nevertheless, I still gave this film a 7 out of 10, because in itself I thought it was a good story and I enjoyed watching most of it. However I do hope that film makers will invent a new genre and stop doing the plot twist thing because frankly, I think we've all seen how that trick works by now so it isn't really going to work anymore.

The Prestige is a movie that makes you feel awed when you walk out of the cinema after seeing it. Not only does it entertain (and that is something it does exceptionally well) but it makes you think for a long time after. The final twist leaves you amazed and exhilarated. It includes magic, love, women, money, travel, self-sacrifice and all these factors put together by an excellent cast make the whole thing spectacular. Christian Bale is unforgettable as the charming Cockney who is charged for the murder of his rival, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman). Caine is wonderful in the traditional role of 'wise mentor' and gives the movie that extra sparkle.However, a dishonorable mention has to be made about the 'Alfred Borden twin scenario'. Its just a little bit predictable. However, some might say, that the twin scenario (being the most predictable) would be the one least expected, as every viewer will expect something absolutely jaw-dropping (like everything else in the film). The Prestige is an excellent example of film, and might even be the best movie of the year.

This movie was so good that I bought the DVD and that's something I don't do very often unless that movie has caught my attention, well it did. It was very well plotted and I loved how Jackman and Bale(in the movie) showed their rivalry, it was really believable. My favorite part was when Robert does this amazing trick that is really hard to explain unless you've seen the movie. But, they used a person that looks just like him(even though it was really him)I expected it to be kind of boring but it didn't bore me one bit. I was interested in the movie from the beginning. If you haven't watched this movie already,I suggest you find a way and see because you will not regret watching it. I jope that Hugh Jackman and Chris Bale could work together and make another movie because this one was phenomenal! I give it a 10/10! Great Movie!

What a fantastic, suspenseful, exciting film! This movie kept you on the edge of your sit the entire time. It made you ask yourself questions and second guess yourself. You can't just watch this movie once. You have to watch it again and again to figure out who is who, what they're doing, and why they're doing it. The tag-line on the front cover of the DVD pins it perfectly: "You want to see it again the second it's over!" I think I've finally got everything figured out now that I've watched it about five times. You learn something new that you missed or didn't see every time you watched it before. But that's why it's so great! Christian Bale is one of my favorite actors and he was phenomenal as the mysterious Alfred Borden. His was the most versatile and dynamic role and he truly made the movie a success. I liked him more as the real Alfred Borden, the one who loved Sarah, rather than his "twin." It was just so amazing how he was able to play both different versions of himself simultaneously. Christian Bale is a very talented actor- one of the best. You also see the dark side of Hugh Jackman and honestly I really didn't like his character much. He really lost sight of what was important and just went too far. In the end he was a completely different person, evil almost. The movie had a fair but just ending. And I thought Rebecca Hall also deserves an honorable mention for her small role in the film as Borden's wife. She played a key role in helping to determine exactly which "Alfred Borden" it was on screen at the time and I thought it was very unique how they did that. All in all, this movie was genius- magical even!

It has been long time I haven't given ten points for a film. "The prestige" deserves all praise sentences.The pledge, the turn and the prestige. The facts that shaped around these concepts are the base of two passionate illusionist's rivalry. But they are more interested in the last stage of illusion that is the prestige. Because it is important that the illusion happened or not, there is no importance for the shape of happening. Two capable illusionist are aware of this reality and devote themselves to beat each other. One of them is Alfred Borden and the other is Robert Angier.To the story that based on a novel, Alfred Borden and Robert Angier starts to work in Cutter's shows. During an illusion Borden causes Angier's wife to die. After this tragic dead, Borden separates his way Cutter and Angier continues with him. Whatever Angier does, Borden's illusions arouse interest between people even if Angier travels to America for the technological support of Nikola Tesla. At last, a machine that Tesla invented is useful for the show of Angier. It is supposed Angier to die by the effort of Borden and Borden goes to jail and waits for the execution day. In fact, Angier doesn't die and Borden doesn't go to jail. The person that jailed and waiting for execution as Borden is his assistant and also dubber. In addition, the person who died during the Angier's last illusion is his clon who produced by the mysterious machine. But no one knows that amazing fact.As I said above, Angier and Borden race for the number one in illusion world and they lose their family for the sake of this purpose. Angier works to gain new numbers owing to machines that Tesla made and Borden works to keep his secrets from Angier. In fact, his secrets aren't so mysterious as Angier supposes. His secrets are very easy and arise from a loyal man like his assistant Fallon. He is so loyal to lose his fingers and go dead instead of Borden.The last things I'll say about the story will be like that. As an electrical engineer, I think there is many injustices about Nikola Tesla in the film. For example, Tesla is pointed out as a man who finance his works owing to such special machine demands. However, his financiers was today's big companies to invent new things about the new forms of electricity. Of course Tesla was a genius,but I think he had never run after such fantastic things. He devoted himself to find out brilliant inventions that will be really useful for the humanity.Let me come to technical details about the film. The story is unusual and mentally worked on it. Besides I want to celebrate the director by the methods that he used. Twists and turns got me amazed many times. Borden's and Angier's daily came to the screen by dividing the story skillfully.Hugh Jackman's performance as Angier is wonderful. Especially Christian Bale charmed me like in his role of Borden. A person could become identifical with his role merely as he did. Scarlett Johansson shows that she is the woman of attractive roles again. The sounds, effects and dialogs are so harmonious with it.The film also gives ideas about the fine points of illusion art. If you haven't watched a remarkable film in recent times, surely watch it.PS : If you didn't understand the film exactly for the first time like me, you may be bored for the second trial.

the prestige is the one of the best Hollywood movie i have seen.t2 and rocky balboa were my previous favorites. This movie is a pure masterpiece.It has the best screenplay and individual performances. Chris bale continues to impress again....Chris Nolan is such a amazing director,i cant see anyone else directing this movie to such perfection...This film cant be remade anywhere else... One who did not get he hang of the movie the first time,has to see it again...you will be amazed.. I cant imagine how much time it took to write this magnificent script,its just top notch..This movie is way better than departed or some other 2006 movie,it should have got an Oscar 100/100..

It's a long time since I saw a film where I was so hooked on the story. The Prestige has a plot so full of twists and turns it merits several viewings - and even then there will be arguments over who did what - but I can honestly say that it is so engrossing that I enjoyed every minute of it again and again. What I really admire is the way everything - every word spoken, every action - was linked throughout the story. Nothing is wasted.I have seen the film criticised for being too cold and calculating. Maybe some of the characters come across in this way, but this isn't a film that wears it's heart on it's sleeve. It's not a romance. I think it goes deeper than that and asks questions about life and what we think are prepared to sacrifice.

What a movie, it's really one of the best movies i have ever watched. It took to me about 5 hours to finished it, i reversed it many times to try to understand. It deserve an Oscar, there's no more, I LOVE "THE PRESTIGE". It is very helpful to get comments of many people who likes movies, I watched it around 3 weeks ago and i have not finished to understand all points, there is a lot of magic. After I red several comments i will watch again, I really want to watch again, maybe this time i will be able to discover all secrets. Thanks to Nolan's for this movie, it makes feel that "good movies" does not finish yet.I am from Mexico, regards

I haven't liked a movie so much for some time now; talking about magic, there is no way to it could possibly address to you like an ordinary realistic movie, though it does not appeal to the tricks of SF. The movie comes forth straight with a genuine magical reality, with an invisible curtain raised little by little, it takes your breath away by the immense number of "tricks", by the action in present time "magically" blended with scenes read from two diaries, and by the changes of supremacy between the two main characters - two apprentices who are friends at first, becoming then fierce enemies (Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman). The two heroes are somehow alike: they are in fact driven by the desire to become the best magician, thus changing the initial rivalry into a "fight for your life" war, which makes each of them cause the other sentimental and physical losses.The first one emotionally hurt (maybe by accident?), is chasing the other - first for revenge, then for finding out the secret of the successful trick involving the queen of the tricks - teleportation; a truthful, imaginative and extremely wise engineer (Michael Caine), gifted at finding magic devices based on recent inventions in the scientific world and responsible for the "making of" the tricks is the "raisonneur" of the movie; a secret machine, which you can't help waiting for intensely, built by a famous physicist, Tesla, in a land which seems to be another world (even if it is "electrically" developed, for the needs of the scientist) also has an important part to play. The women in the movie, be they gentle wives or skilled charming assistants (like Scarlett Johansson) do not enjoy happiness, as the two leading characters are too deep into the obsession for each other.But trust me on this: the "magic" of the movie, the charm of the characters and the turns of the plot may not be described, only experienced - so I invite you to see this movie as "The Prestige"- meaning the third part of a magic trick- by the director, Christopher Nolan.PS - The music is just WONDERFUL!

The movie was wonderful. It kept me guessing until the very end and when the movie was over I want to see it again. I didn't even recognize David Bowie, who plays Tesla. It was a creepy movie and at times I had to close my eyes. This movie isn't suitable for young children under 13. It involves drowning, shooting and chopping off parts of the body. It has some scary parts, but my 11 year old brother was fine. I would only recommend children that young go if they are mature enough to handle the scary parts. Parents, go see the movie next and then judge to see if it is suitable for your children. Teens, this movie is made for you.

The movie, if to be described in a single word, is unbelievable, with the word taken in it's utmost literal sense. Christopher Nolan does his magic on the novel written by Christopher Priest in 1995, and brings it to life in a way no one could have accomplished. With his ability to use flashbacks and mixing the past with the present, Mr.Nolan makes those watching the movie, his audience. The Pledge is simple, two magicians; Alfred Borden(Christian Bale) and Robert Angier(Hugh Jackman) are set to out-do one another. But it seems as if every step the movie takes is The Turn of the whole trick and you must ask yourself, are you watching closely?. The Prestige is where you will be left mesmerized and trying to connect the dots.At times, it may seem as if the movie is moving too fast or if it's too hard to grasp but believe me, when the final curtain is drawn, you will know everything.

Christopher Nolan has directed excellent movies before. There's always a great deal of mystery in his films. This is no exception. Just like in Memento, in the Prestige he uses a fractured time line, giving the necessary information of the future for you to keep wondering how it got there, but he saves the secret for the last minutes. This film is about two magicians who, having been friends and co-workers, begin a rivalry that will eventually destroy them. Magicians are famous for tricking the public into believing something that's not real. Well, that's exactly what Nolan achieves with his script. It's so meticulously thought that it's almost perfect. If you add that to the acting of Bale, Jackman and the other cast members (Caine, Johanssen, Bowie), a romantic sideline and the sci-fi touch, you get one of the best movies in the decade. No doubt about that.

There's not much that can be said about The Prestige that has not already been said in its positive reviews. Christopher Nolan makes yet another remarkable achievement after the groundbreaking Memento and the extraordinary Batman Begins. Once again, Nolan does not for a moment prioritize the "Ooohs!" and "Ahhhs!" before strong character development and plot. By the end, Nolan can use these powerful cinematic tools to create those audience reactions instead of fantastical elements. Nolan is not the only one, however, that makes this movie work as a whole. With his brother, Jonathan Nolan, at the hands of the screenplay, and Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman as the leads, people reading this review are only getting the tip of the iceberg with understanding the quality of this movie. You will have to see this movie for yourself.For those who were disappointed by this year's earlier entry in the "Magician Genre", The Illusionist, then The Prestige is the movie for you. On terms of quality, the two movies are just about polar opposites. While Edward Norton portrays the most wooden performance I've ever seen from him, Christian Bale shines once more. While Norton and Biel couldn't develop chemistry to save their life, the chemistry is magic between Jackman and Johansson and Bale and Rebecca Hall. While Giamatti and some of the cinematography play as the saving grace of the otherwise disastrous Illusionist, there is really only the overlong ending as a weak spot for The Prestige.I would be really ashamed if Bale does not get some Oscar consideration for this year's upcoming awards season. There is not a scene he doesn't shine in, and time and time again, he proves to be one of the best young actors in Hollywood. It is still a toss up for me on which film is the best of the year. It's either this or The Departed, but you cannot go wrong with either. In the scheme of things, despite the minor flaw at the end, this movie gets a perfect 10, and I now await The Dark Knight even more eagerly. Summer 2008 cannot come soon enough. It takes three great movies for me to label a director a genius. Mr. Nolan, you have a fan.

I think this could be Nolan's best movie, I am not sure who wrote this, but who ever did, did a great job. I like the cinematography in this film. It's the same dude who shot Batman Begins, lighting and visuals were awesome. The story was very good, I think I am going to read the book, ha ha. But anyways I wouldn't be surprised if this movie would be in the Academy Awards this as one of the Best Pictures, and if it doesn't make it to Best Picture then I am going to be shocked. I really didn't think Hugh Jackman though was going to be the bad guy, I thought Christian Bale was going to be the bad guy, but it kind of switched around when the Hugh Jackman who wasn't that Lord something, but other than that, I really liked this movie, and I really hope it will go all the way this year.

I am very picky when it comes to movies, and I also like all genres. My favorite genre is a psychological thriller. Having said that this movie just blew my mind. In most movies I can figure out the ending well before the movie is over this one I could not, I was still trying to figure it out after the movie was over. This is the type of movie that as soon as you finish seeing it you will want to see it again. This is a type of movie that you must pay attention throughout the entire film. I was one the edge of my seat and my friend next to me was scratching his head and stomping his feet with excitement after the film was over. I would recommend this film to everyone and especially to those who are into psychological thrillers. This film has Oscar written all over it.

The best way to experience this film is to know nothing about it. I didn't do any research for this film, and I feel that made the film so much better for me. All of the surprises were genuine and I really had to think about what was going on. That's rare for me, and I like David Lynch.This was just such an effective film in terms of sophisticated entertainment. Not a film to miss. I don't want to say anymore because I could very well ruin something for you, which is not something I want to do. Just see it, and when you do, go into it blind and without any preconceived notions. It makes it so much better.

Christopher Nolan, the co-writer/director, loves to over-complicate his films a lot, especially in his twists in the endings, and counts on the simplicity of the masses to get confused and be called a genius despite failing to deliver in his films' ultimate goals: the twists at the end, because most of his films rely on those heavily to be given any meaning or quality at all. In this fairly long-running drama, Bale (as usual) and Jackman produce high quality performances, and special credit given to Bale's wife in the film and David Bowie (who can really act !); in an otherwise strong cinematography flick. The main issue is that the film builds up a great momentum, with lots of twists and turns, but as we're held in suspense for the grande finale at the end, lots of if not everything that's been mounted before seems to crumble as we discover the truth unfolded in the dying, yes *dying*, moments of this disappointment. It's like the end discredits everything that's been building for long chunks of Nolan produce, like the film shoots itself in the foot (or in the head ?). Too bad. This feels like a great, but it surely isn't.

A great disappointment. Save your money and skip this movie. Two rival magicians appear to be one trick ponies. An audience will easily guess the secret behind their apparent magic. The romantic entanglements are entirely unconvincing. Interweaving of characters, the movie viewer never knowing for sure who is who, leaves the film-goer in a muddle. In the end, it is not worth working out the details. A waste of my time, and yours if you see it.Actors are all fine. A bitter rivalry between Nikola Tesla and Edison over direct current or alternating current as the best means of transmitting electricity has just a bit of a mention without all the drama it took in real life. Tesla surprisingly well portrayed by David Bowie. Edison does not appear but sends thugs to burn down Tesla's laboratory. (Highly unlikely.) Too bad the writers did not see fit (or did NOT know) to show the first use of AC in the electric chair to execute condemned criminals was touted by the Edison camp as showing how dangerous AC current was. I would certainly have written this into the script as it would fit nicely with the plot as it developed.I liked "The Illusionist" better as a film about magicians performing on stage, a better portrayal of the Victorian era, and a much better love story. This film never revealed the secret of the magician's tricks, a far better decision thins in "The Prestige".

If you are Perry Mason when you watch this type of movie (like I am), then you will end up figuring out the first half in the first quarter, and the last half in the third quarter. Which means you sit around for half the movie twiddling your thumbs as the deception goes through its motions.The movie goes from almost-plausible drama in the first half (she came out of the water dead with the killer knot still tied), to homicidal science fiction in the second half (I liked the kill-clone-self paradox better the first time I saw it in The 6th Day). I also liked the oddball scene editing better when it was in Memento.Good movie if the wool gets pulled over your eyes, boring if not. Good if you don't mind totally implausible plot devices (two magicians, one with a twin brother and the other with a random man in town who looks exactly like him), bad if not. Good if you don't mind Back To The Future-style scifi, startlingly lame if not.

(Contains no real spoiler, but could prompt a naive viewer to draw conclusions prematurely.) The intrigue of magic, what invites people to suspend disbelief for a moment, is the realization that the trick never IS supernatural; completing it doesn't require the violation of laws of physics, although all one's senses tells you it must.This movie, although beautifully composed and photographed, relies on sci-fi stunts to carry the story, which I think cheapen it and preclude it from being brilliant, even clever.Also, using the analytical tool of working backward from the ending to determine the likelihood of the events that preceded it, there are a number of problems with the story. Apparently, these magicians could not only conjure up illusions, but could also read minds and foretell the future.A big disappointment. . .

It's a movie with a twist that puts it into the realm of unbelievable fantasy crap. And, had me so angry that I wish I had asked for my money back.Why not have space aliens land and be in control of the apparent show? That's how ridiculous, absurd and stupid the film is.The first twist, one magician is actually twins sacrificing their happiness for the magic is great, unpredictable and realistic. I thought the film was going to be brilliant.But, the second, that a man had discovered a replicator, and kept it hidden for his own magic trick while killing himself every night... left me so empty and angry I wish I had never seen the film. What sort of twist is that? Its not even a twist, its a departure from a good film to a very very very bad one.

Some movies, while lingering in your thoughts after leaving the theater, mellow like a fine wine. This turned to vinegar very quickly. The story began sensibly enough, but then quickly degenerates into an incoherent mess, as if the script was half-written when given the studio's green light, financed, and cast, then sloppily given a dopey, intelligence-insulting last written half. Having seen "The Illusionist", I almost thought they had attempted a poor satire of the much, much better movie. As if taking a cue from this nit-witty script, the acting, from such a star-studded cast, was amazingly half-rate. Scarlet Johanssen should not attempt a British accent ever, ever again; even Michael Caine's and Christian Bale's cockney accents were cringe-inducing and they're both British! Even with the large budget they were probably given for set design (it takes place around 1899), they still screwed this up and made it look incredibly amateurish - the scenes of Colorado Springs from a hillside made the town look like a wintertime snow-globe village. The special effects were wasted on the idiotic idea that Nicola Tesla built an energy globe that could replicate objects and, oh my God, people. All in all, a forgettable movie.

The prestige was god awful. The characters mumbled their lines, almost the entire movie was presented in flashback form and it makes you wanna fall asleep.As the movie started I could vaguely tell what was going on, or whether it was flashback or present, the characters mumbled their lines as if they were scared to perform As the movies plot thickens so many times and it adds so many dramatic twists that you begin to lose count and lose interest in what's going on and stop caring. The movie dredged on and on and on, I was falling asleep. As I was falling asleep I was wondering "Why am I sitting here, I can get out and get my money back" and so I did, but I think I should sue for lost time and embarrassment. Short summary, this movie sucked. Interesting Idea, horrible execution. I would have given it a two, but it was so long I couldn't stand it anymore, so 1.

For movie that is in top 250, has such high rating and so much positive reviews it is really disappointing. It is really far from good movie and irritated me so much that I felt like writing my first ever review.First, start with good, or more precisely not so bad. Well, premise is good, and if this was done better maybe I would be interested in how they did tricks. And Tesla was very well done. Bowie was excellent choice for Tesla. Other than that I can't remember even single redeeming quality of this movie.Now, bad parts. Oh boy, where to begin.No likable characters. There isn't a single character in here that I can connect to or even like! And who is there to like? Angier who only wants to steal "magic" trick from Borden with no consideration for those around him? Borden(s) who has such bad attitude towards his wife and daughter? Mother who hangs herself out of jealousy and leaves her daughter alone? Olivia, who is so forgettable that she just dropped out from movie for no apparent reason and no one noticed? Nope, nope and nope... Rest of characters are so bland or appear so little that are not even worth of mentioning. Central plot should be rivalry between two illusionists. But their actions are so unrealistic and bland I had feeling like only thing pushing plot forward was will of the writer. And that is really bad storytelling.In a movie which presents itself like realistic we get such outrages deus-ex for main plot line it made me cringe. A machine that copies anything! A machine in 19th century which copies anything and can teleport! What? Really? Before this was introduced I still had some hope to rate this movie as watchable, but this just buried my hopes. Oh, and why there is no Sci-Fi category mark for this movie is beyond me.Scenes are jumping all over the place. One dude is reading diary of another dude, who at some point is reading diary of first dude, and all of that we get after opening scene that showed us main character die... Did I mentioned confusing time-line? Plot twists. Well, to be frank there is just one and that is revelation that Borden has a twin brother and that is how he does his Transportation trick. So greatest mystery, only thing in this movie worth anything, is revealed to be the simplest possible solution. Still, it wasn't that bad and there are hints to this. Problem is lack of other plot twists in what should be mystery driven movie.And why in the world Borden doesn't reveal his wife that he has a twin... Both twins slept with women they don't like and lied to family because of some stupid illusion trick? And cut fingers? And allow wife to hang herself because of this and leave his daughter motherless? Someone actually wants me to believe that? So when exactly they decided to act like one person? And how no one even noticed, his (their) wife never met ANY relative of Bordens who knew they were twins when they were little? So bad characters, bad plot, bad pacing, no point to the story, bad Sci-Fi elements... How can anyone, let alone so much people, give this movie good review is beyond me.

A very entertaining movie. And as it unfolded I was looking forward to the "twist" at the end, I realized that Borden had a twin. A good twist to be sure. Maybe Angier having a twin would have been a cool twist! But it disappointed me at the end. The movie betrayed it's own reality. There is no such thing as "real" magic! There is always a trick to it! The machine worked?!!! For the machine to actually transport and duplicate was very cool, but it was a cheap betrayal of the plot's own premise! Don't spend an entire movie grounding me in reality and then insert fantasy. I would have accepted a scam, y'know the hats and cats and all. The machine worked?!!! C'mon! Folks, they pulled the ending out of their ass. It was not a twist. It was "magic", and that's lazy movie making that insults the viewer's intelligence!

Is it a sin to want have an enjoyable time when shelling out my hard earned money? Is it too much to ask to have the story make a tiny bit of sense? Am I being unreasonable to want to at identify with, or even like, at least one of a story's characters? In my humble opinion - that's not really asking for too much! When driving home from the theater, it crossed my mind that the two magicians are like Karl Rove, (the Republican party strategist and America's #1 Faustian) - they will do absolutely anything to "win!" As far as the story's two main character's are concerned, that means even commit murder (repeatedly in one case), or drive one's wife to suicide! Perhaps the filmmakers were attempting to drive this point home - there are people like our two magician madmen in the real world! While the word "obsession" is mentioned about a hundred times in this godforsaken story - it's misleading, like a magician's trick. What this film is really about can be summed up in four words - "the banality of evil." How ordinary people can lose track of the simplest of concepts - "right and wrong. "The ends don't justify the means. Being famous, powerful, "and the best" is not more important than love, family, community, friendship, or even one's soul! What a terribly demoralizing story! The only very small bright spot in this entirely dreary film, was bringing Nikola Tesla, the great inventor and energy theorist into the story. His genius is absolutely fascinating. Too bad most viewers will think he's a fictional character like the rest of the story, instead of an important historical figure! It's a shame the story didn't evolve around him! It would have been a tad bit more entertaining! (Put his name through any reliable search engine, and see for yourself!)

"The Prestige, my favorite movie of all time. A perfect movie with probably the best script ever. You got to see it!" This is what I heard from my brother about The Prestige before I watched it for the first time. I knew absolutely nothing about it, I only had promises of a good movie. So close to be true...Before I start to point out what I disliked about this movie, I shall provide a short summary. Two magicians basically compete about who is the best. That pretty much sums it up, and believe me when I say, the story is great and if you like movies that are 90% good you should consider watching it. However, to me that is not an option. I can't like a movie that was almost perfect. That would be like flying with a pilot that is extremely skilled except he does not know how to land. It simply ruins the entire thing.What I'm talking about is the ending. The story, as stated, is about two magicians competing for the best trick. They go from decent tricks into really advanced trick while the tension between them increases. The atmosphere of the movie becomes really exciting and almost a little frightening. Things happen you don't except and you eagerly wait for a good solution. I did not know there would be a "twist" but I expected it after watching most of the movie. When I realized there would be a twist I was so excited I could barely sit still. Boom! There it was... the twist. And what was it? A cloning machine! Pardon my french, but what... the... hell... This movie takes place at about 1899 and the movie is based on making doable, yet amazing tricks. The movie is about them being more clever the the other and cheating each other in the most clever ways. Suddenly, one of them ends up with something like this. A cloning machine! Not even today are you close to being able to clone a human. This makes absolutely no sense.They could have added something like a "science trick", like an outstanding, yet realistic achievement in modern science, something with water or electricity. Or make an even more outstanding, yet doable magic trick. But what do they do? They add something as lame as this.This ruined the entire movie. It made me angrier and angrier. How could they destroy such an epic movie with adding such a horrible ending? To summarize this, Chris Nolan should focus on making movies about men dressing as giant winged rats or people going through a million dream layers, he is good at that, but he can't make serious deep movies with great twists.1/10 - Like flying an airplane, a movie who is a nice ride for two hours and then crashes in the end, is not a ride I want to pay for nor participate in.

This movie had the potential to be excellent. Great setting, great acting, great potential for a twist. However, though this might have been easier to hide in the book, the "twist" was too easily foreseen. The first glance at Fallon, and I said "hey that looks like Christian Bale," but wrote it off as coincidence. However the second time we caught a glimpse of this mysterious character, I figured out the "mystery". An undeveloped character with a beard, lowered hat, and obviously disguised? Hmm. I could tell his eyes were Christian Bale's from the start. And as the movie dragged on, with this character speaking no lines, it only proved the obvious. Fallon is Borden's "double" (twin) with makeup and fake facial hair. He is too underdeveloped, mysterious, and quiet to be anything else. And he just plain looks like Christian Bale! (minus the fatter cheeks from the prosthetic.) The clues stacked up too high throughout. How certain lines to Fallon were worded. His role in the family. The altering personalities of Borden. There was no surprise when Fallon took of the mask and shot his rival. So much for the crazy twist.Though there were some smaller more interesting twists, and the movie was well-done, this ruined the big surprise for me. Also, after developing this great theme of clever outsmarting of your counterpart through illusion and skill, the ending is left to science fiction? Sigh. I wish it wasn't real this time, I wish it was some good magic.

When I left the cinema after watching 'The Prestige', I tried to make head or tail of its storyline and eventually had to give up. This movie is a hotchpotch of unclear situations, flashbacks, mysterious allusions to the extent that in the end nothing makes much sense. Some of the comments on this website did help clarify a number of issues, but in the end the tortuous plot and the all-too-frequent twists and turns had me throw in the towel. It is to be regretted that, in order to ensure the success (?) of a movie, film directors have to resort to irritating 'postmodern' techniques requiring an above-average IQ and a PhD in cinema studies. Oh, for the simplicity and directness of 'Snowwhite and the seven dwarfs'! Among the many unresolved issues, one detail continues to exercise my mind: what is the significance of the small red ball which continues to be thrown at some of the characters and is then thrown back to the sender?

I am so lucky man to see this movie last night
The end scene was the greatest one for me ever

Had to watch two times to fully understand the film truly remarkable

This film was fantastic! So exciting, you never knew what was going to happen and it was so cool because it was magic! Other films followed this one, dealing in magic makers, their crews, their tricks and turns and I love them all. As many more films like this you make, that is how many billions of dollars you can make from them. We love MAGIC! We love the teams formed to create magnificent illusions. Bring it on!

You're not gonna sit and watch a 2 hour another great movie of Nolan. Also its last 5 minutes worth as a hundred other movies at all! You can't guess its end; Nobody can. If someone says I did, he's a lier! Don't loose this fabulous phenomenon. One thing is enough to prove how good this movie is: Directed By Christopher Nolan...

You have to watch this great movie if you like thrilling movies , one phrase I can add if I did watch it I am speechless

A lot of people struggle with choosing 1 movie to be their favorite but The Prestige easily takes it for me. I've watched it over 100 times easy and I just really love how you figure out more and more as you rewatch it over and over.

I mean, you must be kidding me! This was the best movie that I've ever seen in my entire life! This was amazing, beautiful, great, and emotional! I loved it and I 100% enjoyed watching it.

Hands down the best movie I've ever seen despite the score it has. Truly believe it's seriously underrated at 8.5. OK, not the best ever for everyone but the score doesn't fully rewards the movie.

I've rewatched this movie today, the second time because I remember very little of it, and it's a masterpiece. The incredible actors, direction and script are impeccable. One of my favorite movies has, all the same, mystery, suspense, and twist after twist, just perfect.

I am not the biggest fan of Nolan's works (some are good but imho some are pretty overrated/praised like Dunkirk and Interstellar), but this one is (like Inception) a really nice gem with an unusual story.A unique plot woven around two obsessed and rival magicians/illusionists with an amazing cast - Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall and Michael Caine. And on top we get a nice painting of the times around the end of the Nineteenth Century.Good and entertaining.

The best director to ever do it. So well rounded, when a man knows what he is doing the results are obviousl. The scrips is 10/10 the acting is 10/10 the directing is 10/10. WATC IT YOU WANT REGRET IT.

Watching again and again, CBale and HJ together inc.

An amazing movie that everyone needs to enjoy, it's bit complicated & you should be focused all the time 
it confuses you in an interesting ways an keeps you attached even though it's a bit longamazing experience

The answer to that question is "no." Although I found the story quite fascinating and overall, the film well done--another great performance by Michael Caine--in order for it to really work, the audience has to be rooting for someone. As the movie progresses, we find each of the 2 magicians and the women less and less likeable. A look at illusions and magic "backstage" was educational, and I certainly was not bored. However, the conclusion that one magician used cloning was a disappointment as it is impossible, at least in the way it was done in the film. But the worst pill to swallow: although I haven't read ALL the reviews here, I haven't found anyone who addressed the callousness of a twin sacrificing his brother's life as one of them did in the story. And do we REALLY know which one survived?

This is an amazing film. Its a film that makes want to see it again instantly after you've first seen it, partly cause you want to see if everything makes sense, and also cause of how spectacular it is. One of the things I loved about this film was that it never felt like either Huge Jackman's or Christian Bale's character was more important than the other. Both of them are equally as interesting and well performed. The way Christopher Nolan doesn't tell the story in in a typical way and instead decided to jump back and forth from different parts in the story was a genius move. He did it in a way so that it was confusing but never too confusing, how he managed to do that is beyond me. It also never focused too much on the actually magic and was always about the rival between Huge Jackman and Christian Bale. All the performances are great as well. the only bad thing was Scarlett Johansson's British accent which was pretty awful.

After two magician apprentices have a deadly accident in one of their tricks and since then, a bitter rivalry is born between them. Having completely different lives and social positions but also many secrets, the two try to make a life out of magic in a desperate pursuit of the ultimate illusion. Sabotage and dirty hands play an important role in their work but with every failed act, their work but also characters greatly improve.It's a very interesting movie which doesn't amaze you with its magic, but, on the contrary, with its plot, characters and especially, it's finale. It's very complex, extremely well thought and executed, its deep atmosphere drawing you slowly into its world.It's a very good movie for magic lovers like myself, but also for people in search of mind boggling plots. A must see for everyone!

There can't just be a better movie than this. The Prestige turned out better than any movie I had watched so far. A magician's life is surely more complex than what I thought earlier. I simply loved Christian Bale's double role. Michael Caine only made it too perfect. Hugh Jackman did his bit as expected, and so deserves mentioning. The movie definitely deserves a rating much better than it's current. Maybe very few people watched it. The Prestige may just be considered Christopher Nolan's best till date. A must watch for people of all ages. It deserved better than everything it earned-in terms of both popularity, as well as gross.

Warning!!! Contains LOT's of spoilers!So yesterday's evening on TV where running this movie called The Prestige. Before movie I sure checked it on IMDb and saw that is has 8.4 and it has won 2 Oscars. That sure made it worth watching.Evening came and movie started. I played Splinter Cell Conviction and actually weren't in a mood for watching a movie (now thought that I could exchange this movie for SC:C just horrifies me...). First 20 minutes of movie passed. I weren't paying too much attention to movie and didn't understood what's going on. Then I stopped playing SC and thought : "That's all! Let's watch movie."It wasn't easy to understand what's going on but slowly I managed to put everything in places. After all I missed only beginning of movie. As I watched movie I became pulled into movie even more. It was amazing to watch those two Illusionists battle with each other, their tricks, acting in home life and other stuff ( Thank you Jackman, Thank you Bale... You made my evening!). They went even further in their competition, using more unfair methods. I were completely pulled in movie. Movie's storyline was one the best I've seen lately. And then the ending come. The best part. I were totally amazed about Angier's and Borden's game in trying to kill each other. How Angier used his double to send Borden in Jail and how Borden's twin brother sacrificed himself for Borden. In the end I can surely say this is one of the best movies I've seen...P.S. And as the movie ended, and I sat completely stunned tit res appeared and I firstly saw Nolan's name. A smile showed up on my face. "Of course. Nolan. Who else?" Was my first thought.

Class!!!!One word that can outline this prestigious movie.Christopher Nolan after the success of Memento has again shown what qualities he possesses as a director.The script is fantastic.Where does he get those ideas from.Christian Bale again gives a fantastic performance.He has grown as an actor in the past few years.Hugh Jackman does justice to his role.The screenplay is awesome.Also the work of Michael Caine(cutter) is prolific.He keeps saying those one liners that always impress me.Prestigious indeed is the twist at the end.WOW!!!What a twist ??You need to watch this movie twice to understand the mind of Christopher Nolan.Only one question twists me,where does he get all those ideas??Finally prestige has all the answers.Waiting for his next movie.If you believe in magic.The real transported man holds the answers.Also,remember exact science is not exact science.Prestige is the hardest part.But then who was prestigious at the end.Must watch!!

The Prestige is a fantastic film by far. Christopher Nolan has done many fantastic and awesome films. The Prestige is almost as good as The Dark Knight. The Prestige is on my favorites list as #2 because never before have I seen such magic. The Prestige is magic in many ways, either with magic or it's so good it's magic. I haven't seen such fantastic ways of story telling than Nolan's The Presige. The Dark knight has the same sort of theme. Also, his other great and awesome film Memento is very unique. The Prestige has a great cast including:Hugh Jackman(X-Men, Swordfish)Christian Bale(Equilibrium, The Dark Knight)Michael Caine(Sleuth, Miss Congeniality)Scarlett Johannson(He's just not that into you, The Other Boleyn Girl)David Bowie(Labryinth)Scarlett Johannson has a pattern with her film roles. In every film, she plays some sort of skank. In He's Just not that into you, Bradley Cooper's having an affair with her. In The Prestige, she dumps Hugh Jackman for Christian Bale. She has a good reason for that though. She doesn't play a skank in every film, but it sure as hell seems like it. The two main characters are Robert Angier and Alfred Borden. Personally, I prefer Alfred Bordan(Christian Bale). Bordan isn't as much of a prick as Angier(Hugh Jackman). The Prestige has a really clever ending and it definitely deserved the best film of 2006 award. It was only nominated for two Oscars. But it really deserved more because The Prestige is one of the greatest ever.The Plot: After a magic trick goes terribly wrong, two magicians become rivals. When one of them comes up with a fantastic new trick, the other tries to steal it.

If there is already this kind of machine in the world but the scientists don't want to show it to us, then that is horrible. I don't think copying a person is as easy as copying a file on computer. However, it is possible. And we call the technology clone. So when some day you wake up and see a person who is just the same with you, what is your first feeling? Kill him/her or share your life with him/her? No matter what you choose, this person who is exactly you will disturb your normal life. So in some sense, if scientists have already found the technology for cloning people, they'd better not proclaim it. That's my opinion.

Over the past few years, there have been many movies which proved that is possible to combine both action and a good storyline. The Prestige is a clear example of that.Christopher Nolan has made a very good movie that doesn't get boring at any time, and keeps you awaiting for more. The script is great, and the acting doesn't disappoint. Christian Bale is definitely the one who gives the best performance. Nevertheless, the rest of the cast does a pretty good job as well. It gives a clear definition of what the world of magic is made off.If you haven't see it yet, I strongly recommend you to do so.

i came across this movie while while looking through shelves at the library.i overhead some woman talking about how great she thought it was so i thought i'd give it a try.the film was a lot different than i thought it would be,but that doesn't mean i didn't like it.the story kept you confused right up until the end. the characters we're developed rather well and you could feel the tension in a number of different scenes.i really wasn't expecting the movie to end the way it did,because,like a character thought,it was too easy.if you want a film that is entertaining with an original story-line and an allstar cast than look no further.the prestige is for you.

Well, what can i say, it was one of the best movies i ever watched. Christopher Nolan has always been one of my favorite Hollywood directors. I have always enjoyed all his movies, whether it was the memorable Memento or the beginning of the new chapter in Batman Begins. But over here, Nolan has managed to portray a fine movie despite making some changes to the original plot by Christopher Priest. Nolan has managed to pull out excellent performances from Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale. Michael Caine, as ever is, dependable on his role as the sidekick. The ending of the movie actually leaves the viewer gasping for more. I strongly suggest this movie for viewers to watch.

The Prestige is an interesting and unusual movie, with a strong period feel and solid performances from the lead players.However, there are several elements which flaw the movie. One is Tesla's creation for Angier. Having as a Maguffin a machine which does something impossible not only negates the use of stage magic (based on deceptive illusions) as the centre around which the protagonists' rivalry is wound, it also takes the audience out of the movie and fatally weakens the first part of the denouement. Another flaw is Cutter's failure to act to rescue Borden from sentence of death once he discovers that Angier is not dead. Finally, and less importantly, David Bowie's accent as Tesla is a tad unconvincing.To compensate for this, Scarlett Johansson's mild estuary accent, complete with glottal stops, is excellent, pitched at a level where it falls short of blonde Essex girl.If The Prestige is ultimately less than 100% successful, it remains a worthwhile and entertaining movie nonetheless.

I may be 16, but I have seen countless films and have a habit of forgetting the good ones and only retaining my memories of the not so good ones. But I cannot remember any film where I have been on the edge of my seat. With every scene, and the acting of the cast taking my breath away.With likes of "Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine, and a cameo from (DAVID BOWIE)" on the bill you cannot fault this film. If there is any film that should be remembered for ever more, it should be this one. I doubt very much I will come across a film on par with this for many years.All I can say is take a couple of hours out and see this as you will be astonished !!!!!!!

By far one of the best films I have ever seen in my life! This is a film you do not need to be a magician or even like magic for that matter to enjoy it secret's. Bale's performance was so powerful throughout the entire film, as well as Jackman's ETC. The most important part of a film is the ending, and the ending in The Prestige was 10 out of 10! I don't know about anyone else but after seeing it for my first time, I popped the DVD right back in and watched it again because I wanted to spot the difference's in the twin brothers. The first time viewing I was confused in scenes where Borden's personality changes throughout, so the second time gave me a whole different look! I also like the fact that you (the viewer) gets to decide certain things, there is not much that is spelled out for you.Anyway, A man's reach exceeds his imagination!

First of all it really has to be said that Christian Bale is a god amongst men, at least in front of a camera. He always seems to deliver an intense performance on an intense script, and I'm talking without fail. If you've seen American Psycho, Batman Begins, or Equilibrium will understand that Bale almost always ends up playing a serious and obsessive character. This movie is no exception. Bale portrays a magician who ends up in a serious and life threatening rivalry with another magician, played by Hugh Jackman. Now that wasn't a particularly compelling description but I really don't want to ruin anything for you. Hugh Jackman actually delivers an uncharacteristically good performance in this movie, he easily matched Bale. It really was perfect casting. So I haven't really described the storyline but that little sentence earlier is all I'm willing to say because this movie has an amazing twist which I don't want to ruin. All I will say is "complete dedication to your art..." 10 stars no question!

It's a MUST SEE movie. In fact, this movie must be watched at least twice. It elicits enticing existential questions: the kind your brains just WANTS to figure out... A bit like the first time you try to imagine where the universe might end, what it looks like there and what comes next. If you watch the movie and don't get what I mean, just try to put yourself in the place of the magician going into his machine. Now decide which one you would be...and then, what comes next? The reason I say that you must watch it at least twice is that there are a set of events during the story where it becomes apparent that you have to work out which character was actually involved. The first viewing doesn't prepare you for the need to do that. Since I was passively watching the story the first time around, I didn't notice what was actually happening but I was uncomfortably confused from time to time. It is only with repeated viewings that you move towards a better understanding. And I still feel like I need to watch it again because I haven't yet quite figured out what happened in the end with respect to possible use of the machine. The nice thing is, you can figure out a couple of different possibilities and work through their significance. It's a lot of fun.

Christopher Nolan's Memento didn't impress me, although I found the movie's structure interesting. Batman Begins downright disappointed me. Based on these two negative experiences I made the decision of not watching The Prestige when it came out in the theatres. I just knew I wouldn't like it.We all have mistakes we'd like to erase: The Prestige is my mistake. If I could go back in time and watch it on the big screen, I wouldn't think twice. I'd watch it twice actually! The Prestige is simply one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life. I saw it on a Monday and on Tuesday I was watching it again. As labyrinthine as the plot may be, it's never hard to follow (good screen writing and editing deserve credit for this), but you will want to watch it again because it's just too damn good! The Prestige follows the rivalry between Angier and Borden, two stage magicians at the end of the 19th century, as each one struggles to come up with the ultimate magic trick. Rivalry quickly becomes obsession, and deceit, kidnapping and murder become the means they use to reach their goals. Science also plays an unexpected role in this movie, which contributes to one of its more interesting twists. Yes, plural: there are at least 4 major twists in this movie. Too much? Trust me, the Nolan brothers know what they're doing.The cast is superb: we have the always excellent Michael Caine, Christian Bale, who's enjoying a renaissance in his career, Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson. The editing and cinematography are great. I love the art direction: the art crew brings 19th London to life, recreates the magic stages of the time, and speculates on how some of Tesla's inventions would look like.But what I really love in this movie is the screenplay. It might be light on character development, but this is first and foremost a mystery movie. The Nolan brothers do everything to delay giving information and keep suspense alive for as long as possible; they use flashbacks, they use an ingenious diary-within-diary narrative, voice-overs and just a lot of intelligent, and honest, misdirection. If you don't crack the mystery on your own, you have yourself to blame; the movie puts all the answers right in front of you.Watching The Prestige is a unique cinematic experience. It's everything I want from a movie. It's renewed my interest in the Nolans again and has made me anxious about The Dark Knight. If you want to have fun, watch this movie.

A lot of people on the comments are complaining about how unrealistic it was to use Tesla as the inventor of the final trick. Well guys, I suggest you head over to Wikipedia, you'll find out that among the things Tesla was famous for was coming up with a number of outrageous theories. His being in the story fit in very well with the nature of the man himself. Some of his theories were just as mad as what is seen in the movie.Some other people are griping as to the unrealistic nature of the ending. Well, this isn't a drama, it's a horror film. The horror being the obsessive nature of the men involved, if you don't like it, I suggest you watch Sense and Sensibility or the Godfather.-ron

For those who haven't seen "the prestige" yet, i can strongly recommend it to you.The Prestige follows a cleverly constructed story about two magicians,who become rivals, and will stop at nothing to triumph over the other.The movie builds up lots of tension, as both magicians try to harm or destroy the others ones life. I think it's better if you watch this movie with some friends, so that you can discuss your theory about why this and that happened, with them. The acting from hugh jackman and Christian bale couldn't be better.I like the dark and mysterious look of the film and that you don't really understand the whole story until the end. 10 stars for the prestige.

I didn't see this movie in the theaters,(which definitely adds to movies appeal) I saw it on a little TV, and was still blown away by it. I had just seen the Illusionist, and wasn't so sure that I would enjoy another "magic" movie. I was so wrong. I really enjoyed The Illusionist, but The Prestige topped it. I was astounded. The Acting is superb. Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Michael Caine are very very good. The plot, though at times confusing, is wonderfully rich with detail, and very imaginative. This is such a good movie that I could watch three million times in a row, if I was inclined to do so. It is one of those movies that keeps you guessing until the very end, in the revealing scene, where you finally find out Borden's secret, really using a double, which I definitely did not see coming. This movie is a work of art, and I thoroughly enjoyed. This is an A-list movie, with an All-star acting,and one you shouldn't miss!

Where do I begin...this movie is definitely one of my favorite top five films. Christopher Nolan directed this perfectly. When I first saw this on DVD I was just blown away. All the actors were outstanding in this film. The plot and story is really good. I was just sitting there watching with a grin on my face thinking in the back of my head: "This is a good film". I think that a portion of my fondness towards this film may be because that when I was watching it, the power went out and that just built up the suspense.Overall. This film is a must see.10/10

This is not just a movie about magic. the best part is he makes the film itself like a magic trick.the screenplay is organised in a way like a magic trick.IE he keeps creating situations where each time the audience gets to suspicion & at last he pulls out the rabbit over the other end.similar to memento where we understood the 15 min memory loss like experiencing itself thanks to the order of the screenplay.similarly we end up her being the magician's audience rather than the film's audience.i tell you. u got to watch intensely to know the way the director has carried the audience. when u do not understand the situations & not encourage your doubts you might only end your experience as partly logical & one supernatural portion of the film.i might not have been impressed if it were a linear screenplay.like i said the non linear magic trick fitted the story like jigsaw.if u take a suspense film.u got to be a genius if at the end of the day the audience end up satisfied by the suspense itself more than the end disclosure itself. i came to a situation where i could accept anything supernatural in the plot of a perfectly logical film.now that was a fact not all would approve of.u can have a dozen way of criticizing but what matters is how uve been carried into the film & how good u feel about it even before its end & even a normal supposed to be spoiler supernatural end only make you feel not any less good.lots of contradictions & irony in this film eg.eg.magician's life is about simple day today logical tricks while science produces the real magic.but the best part is the way he displayed the one superficial part of the film which is logically supposed to be a spoiler considering the other strong logics of the film. he built the suspense so much that at the time of revealing the mystery the audience is already into his hands & it doesn't matter how it ends & the best logical way to end the magical suspense is a real supernatural thing itself.we grow too accustomed to appreciating logic behind a magic trick that at the end the we are inclined to appreciate the supernatural.& what more once again like a magic trick the real magic of story was not in angers disclosure but of Borden's secret which we & the characters could have guessed several times but only end up stupefied by this. i was more surprised of burdens secret than angers. i appreciated a supernatural plot while i was stupefied by a logical reasoning of burdens.now that is real magic & cinematic genius.Jonathon Nolan has his strength in screenplay.now he has chosen topics which complement this non linear screenplay. now this is a team that is genius. i tell you. u got to watch intensely to know the way the director has carried the audience because not understanding the situations & not encouraging the doubts might only end your experience as partly logical & one supernatural aspect of the film.

I went into this with somewhat low expectations since I really didn't care much for Nolan and Bale's collaboration on "Batman Begins" and I haven't seen anything else by Nolan. I guess I heard some good things about it, plus it was about magicians and my girlfriend will watch anything with David Bowie. Well, I was pretty much floored because it's one of the most enjoyable and intriguing films I've seen in the last few years. With the exception of Johansson who doesn't seem to know what to do with her role, every performance was memorable. Bale finally convinced me that he's a leading man, Jackman was for once as good as his talent would make you think he should be, and it was especially refreshing to see Bowie and Michael Caine in a movie that's actually good for a change. The direction is very stylish but at the same time always appropriate. The twin diary narrative really serves the film well. I always love that moment when the story catches up to the narrator and you never really know if the narrator has all the clues up to that point. When the movie reaches the point where the narration began (in this case, the trip to Colorado to find Tesla), a whole new set of possibilities is opened up and it's almost like you can start the movie all over again.I have to give it some more time to set in but I'm excited about watching it again because there are so many lines and even whole scenes that take on a different meaning once the conclusion is known. Some of the things that felt pretty weak the first time around (i.e. "I loved you yesterday") could become either poignant or at least ironic. Some things that felt strong already (i.e. "nobody cares about the man in the box") become disturbingly resonant.I love movies that are able to entertain with a narrative and at the same time suggest themes about film itself or entertainment in general that mirror the story. This is really one of the better recent examples of this type of writing  the whole film fulfills the model of the magician and the 3 moments in a magic trick. The film presents us with some situations that seem mundane (the relationship with wife and mistress, Angiers' obsession with the Transported Man trick), then it "turns" and makes these mundane relationships feel bizarre and twisted (and possibly unreal) only to deliver a superb "prestige" in the end which makes us realize that there IS emotional truth in these characters despite the more bizarre aspects of their character development. Perhaps the only serious flaw in the film is that the process takes so long to unravel that the audience has already decided long before the end that they don't like either of these characters  you can only sit in the darkened theater afterwards to ponder whether perhaps one of these two brothers wasn't quite as bad as the other."Are you watching closely?"  in terms of meaning, it could just as easily have been a command: "Watch closely." But I think that would describe a different, and less polemical, movie. I think it was written as a question because this movie really seeks to engage the audience, not just to blow us away with effects, acting, story revelations, but to make us think about what we're seeing, to be constantly questioning what the film seems to expect us to believe. The magic trick won't even work without the audience's willing participation in the larger scheme of mystery and revelation. So I'm slightly surprised that so many posters here as well as intelligent film critics like Roger Ebert seem to consider the steampunkish sci-fi elements associated with the Tesla character to be out of place or even a betrayal of the audience's faith. I felt from the very first moments of the film that there were really no rules about where the story could take us. And frankly, it's a cool idea and it adds a lot of wonder and amazement to the story's conclusion. Sure, the film may not qualify as "high fantasy" or even perhaps as science fiction (since there's no likely explanation in sight as to why the device should work other than Tesla's reputation and the mystique he was given by the director and writers), but I think there's no real reason why a fantasy element can't be introduced late in the story and that the entire framework should adequately prepare the viewer to accept the possibility of Tesla's device working since the Tesla element is one of the first explored at least initially in the narrative despite taking place later in the sequence of events. Bowie and Serkis are fantastic as a pair of modern-day wizards, and the whole idea of using Edison's men as villains is priceless and will striek anyone who knows early cinema history as very true. People in general might not know about how brutal Edison's goons were when they enforced his patents and crushed his competitors; Edison's own self-aggrandizing behavior still skews our picture of him to this day. This movie is a great bit of overdue payback on behalf of Tesla from Hollywood, a town founded by people escaping Edison's goons but who later helped to create his myth through film.

The Prestige is a highly rich and complex linear narrative that contains many non-conventional elements throughout its storyline. It is compact with multiple themes and motifs that cue the viewer to suspend disbelief, acquire poetic faith, engage in mind-boggling inquiry, and become active participants in determining what is ethical. It is a story that centers upon the darkness of magic. The explicit query, "Are you watching closely?" provides a profound subtext throughout the film in asking the following: What is real and what is illusion? Examining the nature of self-sacrifice and to what extent its meaning is skewed is another common question asked. It effectively manipulates the viewer's emotions in providing no real protagonist but rather invites them to carefully consider there own heroism. What is meant by this is that the viewer is given a choice after seeing what dire consequences fall upon the lead antagonists of the piece. The choice is the following: Either you walk away feeling bitter about the unethical values these two characters held, or, you obtain a heroic and metaphorical textbook on how not to act when offenses come into your life. This is the predominant theme of the film: Although offenses will come, suspend what you consider unethical in other's views by allowing tolerance to teach you a lesson on how not to react when feelings are injured. In following the traditional aristocratic method of storytelling, The Prestige examines the lives of two skilled magicians whose hearts lack forgiveness and whose obsessions with becoming the "greatest magicians of all time" thwart their opportunities to be happy. In an ongoing battle of jealousy, envy and meticulous revenge, the two men become slaves to their illusions and end up sacrificing what's most important to themtheir lives; their families. The editing of this film is rather non-conventional and illusory. In support of the subject of magic, it eludes both time and space to create an off-set, spatial and temporal ambiguity. The viewer is constantly thrust between past, present and future settings through the use of journals being read, stories being told, and first-person narrations of both antagonists. The effect of this parallel editing is used to keep the viewer on his/her feet in determining what is real and what is not. Director Christopher Nolan made some rather poignant directing choices during the process of analyzing, interpreting and conceptualizing the piece. One particular choice is of choosing the concept of magic to examine the many avenues (both metaphysical and transcendental) of deceit amongst the characters. One such avenue is of deceiving the viewer on what type of genre the film is. Upon entering the theater, the viewer most likely suspends disbelief to the psychological thriller or drama genre, little knowing that half-way through the film it will become a science-fiction piece. The reason this works and why the viewer ought not to feel disappointment by its "unrealistic" qualities is that the film itself is based upon the idea of magic being a form of enchantment and illusion. Nolan is able to get away with switching the genre for this very reason. However, this is the only reason. If the film were to contemplate any other theme than magic, it most likely would not work. It's as if Nolan is performing his own prestige over the viewer's assumptions and parading their expectations with suspense and surprise. Like the characters in his film, Nolan too has sacrificed much in making this film. Any film as complexly deep and rich as this one is had to have been extremely well thought out and prepared for. The choice of setting the story in the early 1900's reflects the beginning of the post-modernist and film phenomenological eraone which has no fixed meaning other than what the viewer brings to it. It's completely fitting for a story as ambivalent and open-ended as this one is where meaning can literally be derived from anywhere.

This movie kept me paying absolute attention to every dialog, every new thing that come up, and it made me guess "What's next?" every time, and what's most fulfilling about the movie, is that in the end, it answers all questions and leave you without doubts about reasons and motives. In other words, it has no holes, and that was my sensation in the end, that it created lots of questions that I wanted the answer, and it answered properlyThe story is very original, and the way it is passed to the spectator is also interesting, different and original. It really had a good effect on me.When I saw the trailer, I expected something totally different from what I've saw.

This is the best movie that I've seen for quite some time. The story is so brilliant written, specially because Nolan builds upon the mystical inventions of Tesla, greed and over achievement and the plot is just brilliant even in it's obviousness. To be honest I thought the Bordens were twins because Christian Bale's character(s) have slightly different accents and to confirm it I got the DVD and played it and listened very carefully and you can here that one character has a bit more of a cockney accent than the other. Also then the whole "finger ordeal", the one little line that Borden's wife says: "It looks like it's the same as it happens" falls into place. The movie is great when you see it the first time and even more enjoyable when you see it the second time, because you know the plot and you start to pay attention to all the other little details.Christian Bale plays a terrific role but also Hugh Jackman is not to be forgotten, the way how he plays the frustration not able to figure out how Alfred Borden does the transported man trick is so vivid.The Nolans have proved to be some of the best screen writers and Christopher Nolan one of the best directors. If you don't believe me watch this movie and Batman Begins and you know what I mean. I like the way that Nolan likes to film out of the hand (specially in this film), so shots are very dynamic and contain a lot of movement without having to force your dinner down unlike for instance Transformers. This motion of the camera around the actors really add to the whole mystique around the two main characters.And a special not for Michael Caine who has always been one of my favorite actors and his character is so crucial to this film but he remains on the background as an engineer. I think it's superb who a grand actor like him can do this.Two thumbs up for this movie!

Christoper Nolan impressed me with Batman Begins,and more so with this movie,i believe we have a new great director and writer,not to mention the outstanding talents of Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman,needless to say,MIchael Caine and David Bowie turn in outstanding performances,Mr. Nolan,I salute you,i will be thrilled to see real movie making for a change,excellent.i was just informed that my comment is not long enough,i do not know what else to say,enjoyment of this movie and the twisting plots and surprises are truly mind benders,and i forgot to mention the lovely Scarlett Johanson,i would walk on 10 miles of broken glass to give her a hug,she is a visual delight in every sense of the word.On a technical note,the editing and cinematography were excellent,and the script is something to behold,keep up the good work Mr.Nolan and no doubt there is a bright star shining for Christian Bale,he has been outstanding since the Spielberg classic,Empire of The Sun,i love the way he toys with accents,a great deal of talent there

The first time I saw this film, I was somewhat disappointed with it. The imagery is quite beautiful throughout, and I enjoyed the bits where they revealed how certain magical tricks worked (the bird vanishing/reappearing trick was particularly good). These scenes do a very good job of showing you how everything is an illusion, and you need to figure out what's going on behind the scenes (which seems to be the obsession of both magicians, played ably by Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman). But I focused a bit too much on that aspect of it and was disappointed with one aspect of the latter half, where all rational/realistic explanation fails and the movie becomes somewhat fantastic. This, I felt, compromised the earlier promise of the movie to reveal how everything was simply an illusion that could be explained by ordinary means.The second time I saw the film, however, I appreciated it significantly more. Instead of viewing the movie as a story about how two men are constantly trying to outdo each other by building progressively more complex illusions, I saw it as a cautionary tale about obsession (a motif which I put on the back-burner the first time around since its full impact doesn't hit until the very end of the film). The lengths to which BOTH of the men go to achieve their art is thrilling and terrifying--and in this light, the movie is an engaging success.

The Prestige is a very good movie and I have watched it several times. I found the acting, rivalry and drama to be superb. However having read biographies of the Great Man Tesla and I would recommend you do as well, as he was the father of AC current, robotics and radio, and led the life of an obsessive compulsive Genius, giving his patents away to Westinghouse, ruined financially in the end. My difficulty with the end of this movie is one of knowledge. Tesla creates a machine that can duplicate animal or thing, yet does not possess the foresight to duplicate the thing he needs the most, the financial ability to become independent, by replicating the money he needs so much and to turn his dreams into reality. I understand this is just a movie and all movies have flaws but this one slip spoils it for me somewhat but it is still worth the watch.

A good suspense film is very much like a magician's trick: we have absolutely no idea where this remarkable lead-up is taking us, and the final revelation is so mind-blowing that, after the curtains come down, we find ourselves stumbling from the theatre in a delightful daze of exhilaration and satisfaction. Already, we are arguing with the person who was sitting beside us: how was it all accomplished? One by one, most of the pieces slowly fall into place, but the film/magician still retain a sense of mystery, of wonder, of magic. Christopher Nolan's 'The Prestige' is precisely this sort of film. In the grand scheme of things, it is something of a nonentity, destined to become neither significant nor influential; however, it is such a invigorating thrill-ride that you get the sense that it is the promise of films like this that is the very reason we go to the cinema.Having already established his reputation as the director of 'Memento' and 'Batman Begins,' Christopher Nolan here cements his place as one of Hollywood's most exciting talents. 'The Prestige,' a riveting tale of magician rivalry, is set in England at the turn of the 20th century (much like its contemporary, Neil Burger's excellent 'The Illusionist') and stars Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale in top-form. It was adapted from Christopher Priest's successful 1995 novel of the same name, with the screenplay penned by the director and his brother Jonathon Nolan, who, once again, employ the use of their favoured non-linear narrative structure. The title refers to the third of three fictional components of a typical magic trick, as outlined in Priest's story: The Pledge ("The magician shows you something ordinary"), The Turn ("The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary") and, finally, The Prestige ("making something disappear isn't enough; you have to bring it back. That's why every magic trick has a third act, the hardest part, the part we call "The Prestige.").Christian Bale plays Alfred Borden, an ambitious budding magician who is willing to sacrifice everything to become the greatest of all time. Hugh Jackman is Robert Angier, a born showman, who tragically lost is wife (Piper Perabo) during a failed underwater predicament escape, an accident for which he blames Borden. As the two magicians part ways for separate careers, Angier bitterly despises that Borden has formed a family and found happiness, and their professional and personal rivalry only intensifies when Borden pulls off "the greatest magic trick ever seen," known as The Transported Man. Desperate to upstage his competitor, Angier travels across the world to try and duplicate Borden's trick, his search leading him to the remote American laboratory of physicist Nikola Tesla (David Bowie), whose work with Alternating Current electricity has spawned an invention of staggering capabilities.Aside from the passionate performances of its two leads, 'The Prestige' is also held together by numerous supporting roles of varying quality. Michael Caine is excellent as Cutter, the aging mentor whose experience and wisdom helps Angier on numerous occasions, though Angier's decision to neglect his old friend's confidence ultimately leads to his own downfall. Scarlett Johansson is competent as Olivia Wenscombe, the stage assistant who becomes the love interest of both rivals at some point during the film. The role was hardly a demanding one, basically requiring the actress to be on screen and to look glamorous; but, all things considered, she does this very well. David Bowie, rather strangely, has a riveting on screen presence as the real-life inventor Nikola Tesla, and Andy Serkis is enjoyable to watch as Tesla's assistant, Alley. Additionally, Rebecca Hall is pretty good as Borden's wife, Sarah, who is driven into depression by her husband's alternating personality and fierce dedication towards his work.The competition between the two magicians is absolutely thrilling to watch, as each continues to sabotage the other's work, in a grim and futile attempt to gain the upper hand. Obsession is one of the film's dominant themes, with Angier eventually becoming so dangerously infatuated with Borden's magic trick that he loses everything and everyone he cares about. Borden, meanwhile, also loses much that he loves, a sacrifice he is seemingly more-than-willing to make, though he is eventually given the opportunity to redeem himself. Mirroring this bitter antagonism is the rivalry between Tesla and (an unseen) Thomas Edison, with the latter  an advocate of DC electricity  taking numerous drastic steps to destroy the AC electricity experiments of his contemporary. Though largely grounded firmly in reality, 'The Prestige' takes a science-fiction turn in its climax, which may prove something of a cop-out for some, but will delight those who are enthusiastic about the genre.'The Prestige' is a film with numerous twists to always keep you thinking, and, like a good magic trick, you'll be talking about it for hours after the show is over. Having watched the film a second time, I was pleased to find that the story (which has been described by some to be merely "gimmicky") holds up well on multiple viewing. Another interesting thing to note is that the hints towards the final twist are certainly there in full-view for you to notice the only thing is, you won't notice them. Why? Because, of course, you're not really looking. You don't really want to know. You want to be fooled.

It attracts you at first because it treats a subject everyone likes: magic and its secrets. But then, from the start, you see the plot quickly thicken. Writer and director Christopher Nolan, who has already proved his brilliance with Memento, plays with the timing of the story yet again by skillfully shuffling four different periods in the storyline, and adds an exciting pace by revealing a new twist with every step, so you never get used to anything or bored. The performances are dead-on and the actors very well cast indeed. A little too long, but it pays to see it all through. You want to have some fun? Try to figure out what happens next. The movie will by far exceed your expectations. Very entertaining indeed.By the way, Tesla existed in real life, though I seriously doubt he built all the things shown in the movie.

now now now Mr. Nolan is the master director of these times is not an unknown thing. anyone doubts it pls watch prestige. watch it again and watch it again, try to find faults if u can, there are none. the performances are goood very gooood. Hugh Jackman and Christian bale just kick ass and convince you that they are the characters. the beauty of this movie is the script. the camera work is so cool and profound that you will feel that you are in every frame of the movie, right there watching it happen in front of you. it does get a bit slow in the middle but the end makes up for it this movie talks about rivalry gone wrong wholly wrong. rivalry is good but once it comes to the stage of rivalry Jackman and Bale have in this movie u just know something bad is gonna happen and shows what competition can do to completely normal people. flawless and wow mazing it will leave u stunned this is one film, after watching i was left stunned, never has a movie done that to me. the end will just take u by surprise and make you hail Nolan as the king of the present age. watch it.

I am not sure why this is so how on the all time list, but this was an extremely entertaining film. There is not much to say that this is an extremely entertaining film, that does everything right. With all of the twists most of which I did not see coming. I had a feeling about the twin, but not 100% percent sure. Since Cutter was a character outside of the movie I was sure he was right about the body double and that could only be achieved by his brother, but as a viewer I wanted to believe that part was magic. I just read a few arguments that people have about the movie and I try to instigate discussions at the end of movies (like I like to do with Pan's Labrynth), but I think this movie really did a good job of remember that this was just a movie and listening to Christopher Nolan's commentary on the making of the film, but tells me that the whole point of this movie was to trick the viewer into believing what we saw was real, not because we actually believe, but because we want to. I think the end with Jackman's character was unnecessary and conflicted with the character and it should have been left that Bale's character was not only the better magician, but the better human being. The performances were great especially Caine's. The accent's slipped a few times on the main characters, but still over all a great 2 hours of my life. I really was on the edge of my seat the entire time. This is one of the few movies, where the director succeeds in creating a world that as a viewer I wanted to believe in.

Hugh Jackman has come a long way. So has Christian Bale. Their acting talents are clearly on show in this awesome film.The Prestige is about two rivals magicians trying to better one another with a series of tricks that will lead to a fight for the final, ultimate trick. A trick they will be remembered for. It follows Hugh Jackman (Angiers) as he tries to understand how on earth his nemesis Christian Bale (Boarden) has created the 'best trick he has ever seen.' - The Transported Man... He desperately tries to imitate it, but can never seem to get it right... And soon it becomes clear that he will go to alarming lengths to find the secret...An amazing storyline, a powerful unique plot. An ending with amazing twists to die for. Realistic, dramatic performances from an outstanding cast... Including support from Scarlett Johanssen, David Bowie and the superb Michael Caine as Cutter... I really enjoyed this film...My favourite bit... May spoil it a little...Angiers has completed his diabolical scheme to defeat his rival... And Michael Caine confronts him. Before an amazing twist in the story comes, watch closely... Or you'll never spot it...They talk--- Cutter: Remember I told you what the sailor said about drowning? Angiers: He said it was like going home... Cutter: I lied. He said, it was agony.As dramatic as Brando's taxi scene and as conclusive to this film as I think you could get... Except of course for the brilliant twist that follows... Of course... You may know what I mean by this if you've seen it, and if not then oh well. Look closer next time...I highly rate this film, and only a little common sense in me has refrained me from giving it a 10/10 - Although it may deserve such a rating... Who knows? Tra.

This is the best film i have ever seen. It's simply awesome! When i was watching this film, i couldn't stop myself, even i wanted to go to the loo. There's no doubt that everyone will love this film."Now you're looking for the secret... but you won't find it because you're not really looking. You don't really want to know the secret... You want to be fooled. " I love this sentence very much, it includes all the summary and plot in this movie. There's a lot of twists and turns, you can't believe what you've seen, the answers are always different to what you've think of....

It has to be among the best movies made for quite some time. Christopher Nolan has again proved to be a gem. Christian Bale does his role with ease. All the characters just fit in so easy. Who ever thought that a story on eighteenth century magicians could be so interesting, involving and damn it, I have to agree it was deceptive, it does not fit in with the mind boggling sci-fi movie category but the script was so well written, that one cant just appreciate the movie if he does not get involved with it. The logic for a part of the ending can be conceived with many possible start points, but the beauty of this movie is, whatever be the start point and whatever be the path of your reasoning, you'll end up saying "wow" to the end. You might continue to debate on the nuances behind "how it could have happened", but you'll never debate on the quality of this gem. Congrats Mr. Nolan, "The Prestige" is the rightful successor to "Memento".

I watched this movie once on a weekend night while I had other things on my mind, but then watched it again at home by myself and felt it was one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time. I'm not good with words, but this movie has everything a true movie goer is looking for. From theatrics to a great storyline to a great message. I gave this flick a 10 and recommend it to anyone that has a passion for movies like myself-joeI said what I want to say but IMDb, though being a site I like very much is giving me issues for not having enough lines in my comment. I typed all that I was willing to say and am now simply dragging on so that my post may be seen by others. I appreciate everyones patience and thank you if you've actually read this far, Thank You, Joe Magnuson

Layer upon layer of this story keeps sweeping over me. It lapses and recedes, fading after only a few minutes past the credits. I'd like recommend this movie not only as an entertainment, but as a philosophic proposal about 'right' versus 'wrong'.The movie begins with a very good question about "getting your hands dirty" and it's this very question that adults *should* think about when facing judgment about war and crime. The fact is that anybody can justify how far they go. But it's the accountability to those whom you effect that matters.For those who haven't seen the movie, this all probably means nothing to you and you think I'm talking like an idiot. Assume you are right and see the movie anyway. It's dark humor and tricks will give credit to a well made production, with the well-matched talents of all the actors.It seems funny that they had to get Hugh to take off his shirt in almost any movie he's been in, and while I don't complain about it, it seemed almost cheap for this performance. I wonder if it was in the contract?This was an emotionally turbulent movie, and although I never felt compelled to cry due to my leathery nature, there are many significant scenes that would be too traumatic for the gentle-hearted and young. Seeing someone drown is bad one time, seeing it happen several times is even more so. Funny how watching an actor get shot isn't nearly as harmful?

This is why I go the cinema. To be entertained. And this movie does it all the way through. Highly engaging, compelling, stimulating, exciting, the superlatives go on and on. The cinematography is worth admission alone. Great performance from all actors except David Bowie who just about passed first base. The period setting was totally convincing and the on stage drama the best since Amadeus. The intense atmosphere created by Bale and his stage rivals really keeps your eyes glued to the screen. The film really has the lot, including just the right amount of romantic interest but not too much and the girls are quite stunning.I would give this film a best movie Oscar.

This movie was excellent. Probably the most original I have seen all year. It was a little confusing to some people(my friend was totally lost) but at the end you will either be saying "Huh?" or "OHHHH!! I GET IT!". I understood it, and then I had to spend 15 minutes explaining it to my friend. When he finally got it, I had to bring it over to my friend, Annie's house, so she could watch it.The movie has a great story. Robert Angier and Alfred Bordan are two magicians, they are friends and both excellent magicians. But after Angier's wife, Julia(Piper Perabo) drowns in a trick gone wrong, the two become enemies for life. Angier is now trying to steal Bordan's trick of magic. So he sends his beautiful assistant(and lover), Olivia Wenscombe(Scarlett Johannson) to steal it for him. Olivia doesn't like this, so she hates Angier and becomes Bordan's lover and partner. Also, Bordan is having trouble at home, his wife Sarah, is having a hard time living the way they are. I don't want to spoil anything more.The performances were excellent. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale were terrific in their roles and played them perfectly. Michael Caine plays Cutter, and that's another wonderful performance. Scarlett Johansson was good as Olivia. Some people complained she was flat compared to the other actors, but I liked her in here. Her fake accent was very convincing. Same goes for Piper Perabo(Julia). She wasn't in the film very long but she played it very well and put on the fake accent very well. My favorite performance was by Bordan's daughter, Jess. She was just so adorable. I also liked the performance of Sarah. I felt very bad for her because she started out happy and then she just was never happy anymore. This was a great film. One of the best. Comes in my top 4(The Departed, Little Miss Sunshine, The Prestige, Casino Royale) I highly recommend this movie. It was very good. Great cast, great script, great story, great directing! Acting: A+ Script: A+ Story: A+ Plot Twists: A+ Suspense: A+ Ending: A+Final Grade: A+ Stars: 10/10 Percent: 100In general: This movie rules!

Not much to add to the comments about a film that will be remembered as an outstanding milestone in the careers of Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Christopher Nolan. Except to note that Rebecca Hall turns in a heartbreaking performance as the loving, tragic Sarah, victim of her husband's obsession, despite his partial (not exactly the right word but what is) love for her. Her perceptive take on the secret defining her husband's twisted nature is the essential clue in the movie, though so subtly put that it's almost impossible to catch until that secret is revealed.What a year for great movies! "Illusionist", "Scarlet Veil", "Prestige", "Last King of Scotland", "Babel", "Scandal", etc, etc...And even the flawed films like "Good German" had riveting performances. Film is back this year in a fantastic way and "Prestige" is one of the, if not the, best.

What do you want me say about this movie. It is an excellent movie, it has all meaning of thriller, surprising movie, full of twists. All i can say that this movie is a masterpiece. Believe me watch it and see for your self. The acting by Christian.B. is excellent so is Hugh Jackman. The story is unique well written and directed. Well basically u will be surprised the whole time, this movie took the 1st place in my top 10 collection instead of the Godfather. ;). I really enjoyed every second of this movie, and the time really went fast. I really thought it should be 3 or 4 houres long thats how interesting this movie was.So i give this movie 10 out of 10 for perfection.

I have been a rather large fan of Christopher Nolan's work, (Batman Begins, Memento, Insomnia...) and The Prestige is no exception. It is extremely well directed and very well written. The acting is mostly amazing! I never though Hugh Jackman could do such a good job acting. And Christian Bale... Great! I was told about this movie from a friend of mine, and when he told me about it, I was really pessimistic about going to see it... Boy, was I wrong. I was expecting a movie that was long, boring, and just hard to watch... Take it from me, this movie is none of those three things. I definitely believe that this movie deserves its spot in the top 250. I even think it should be brought down into the low 100s, if not the high 90s. THis movie has made a spot in my top 5, and I really think this is one of very few modern-day masterpieces.

Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are extraordinary in this mind-bending fantasy thriller. I couldn't get enough of the movie and it's true - you immediately want to watch it a second time. Well directed and written, spectacularly acted by the whole cast and it keeps you guessing even after the credits finish rolling.If that isn't enough, the cinematography and art direction were wonderful. There's a real "magic" feel to the film and a surreal sense of wonderland. Who is the true protagonist? Antagonist? What is real and what is illusion? This film will keep you on the edge of your seat. Watch and decide for yourself. It's worth it.

Christopher Nolen further proves that he's definitely a writer/director to look out for with this excellent tale of feuding magicians. Without naming any actors specifically, they're all uniformly great in this film. I was captivated from beginning to end and that in itself is pretty impressive and no mean feat. The fact that none of the actors were even nominated for this years Oscars is a mild travesty as it's definitely one of the best acted films I'd seen in 2006. And yes the ending can be seen coming a whiles away if one's paying even the mildest of attention, but that doesn't really detract from the experience one iota. It's definitely not a feel good movie to say the least, but it's simply superb.My Grade: A

We are a very finicky movie-going-group. We check reviews & friends that have seen a movie before making the rare trip to the theater. This movie is definitely one you will want to see on both the big screen & add to your home collection. There are so many different turns & twists that keep your attention, you will not notice the few slow spots. The only (slightly) negative things we did not enjoy were the overly darkened scenes that made it difficult to see what was happening & some use of very low sound tracks during some crucial dialog. This script has one of the absolute best endings I have witnessed in years - not one of us saw it coming, even though the clues were right there all along (think '6th Sense'). I especially enjoyed the fact that there was no gratuitous sex or needless gore. Our little group could Not stop talking about this movie & anxiously wait to see it again (& again).

It's a movie that could change the way you "act" your life, and interact with people, things and feelings around you. It may get you to study about the magic tricks and illusions and there you will understand after a while, the thing that this movie shows. Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Actors, writers, directors and all crew! Bravo! And really looking through the other comments, and judging by myself i really don't think i have seen anything like it. And the music gets you involve a lot, some said it's a little too long, the time you INVEST watching this movie deserves every minute. And i would ask each and everyone of you that saw this movie and read this comment: "share it with all the people you know", don't start to tell them more than you can see on-line, the description of it, send them to the theater to see it.

The Prestige, aptly suited for the title...you can not ignore it. The word Prestige itself means the final part/act of the magic trick, and the film ends with a well crafted ending. I have not read the novel, by Christopher Priest, but then the picturization is complete in itself...at least for me.To what limits can a man go to take revenge...or for the ultimate magic trick. The film is a carefully woven tale of two magicians and their rivalry, and is something that keep you glued to your seats right till the end. Now thats some storytelling. A must see for Nolan's fan and I just kept thinking, how does he do it. The Memento and Batman Begins fame director/screenplay writer at his best again. The way his films are directed, the manner in which story is told always keeps you captivated and there is certainly no escaping this one. Go ahead and see for yourself for the ultimate magic trick...

In my opinion this movie was one of the best of 2006. The cast, the director, the script was perfect! The cast of this movie was really well selected. Both actors Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale work so great together. You can feel the heat between this two magicians rivalry. Scarlett Johansson gives a good performance. It's very creative, how everything was done in this movie. The twists of this movie are incredible! Makes you go back and forth. It's very genius how everything falls into place in the end of the movie. Also the way it was edited was absolutely genius. The main thesis sticks to the end. In addition, the quotes from the movie are absolutely great. It's definably watching over and over again. It's worth your time. Truly a MUST see!

I had seen the trailer for this film but didn't know what to think of it. I put off watching it several times, but when i eventually did watch it.... WOW!!!! What a fantastic film it turned out to be. Michael Caine is great, as are the two leading male roles. Plus the added bonus of the gorgeous Scarlett Johannson, she is just simply stunning. She'd look good in whatever you dressed her in, plus she can act too. The twists and turns in this film are great, they keep you hooked right till the end, and what an ending. The other good thing about it is it takes you back in time to explain certain things that happen in the movie. Very well directed. I enjoyed it that much, i took my girlfriend to see it a couple of days later, and thoroughly enjoyed it once more. Really is a must see film.

You don't see this kind of movies coming to scene every year, it might take another decade to watch such an excellent one. I think The two magicians can represent two poles of any kind: From the scale of two normal persons competing in real life to two country leaders. Two rivals obsessed by a self destructive competition for the sake of getting all the glory. They both forgot the initial reason for which they started this. Each of them became obsessed trying to become the greatest no matter what the cost is. The choice of magic as a playground competition is the right one, as magicians trick the audience with illusions, it could be leaders tricking their people in real life with their own kind of illusions(Wrong cause, wrong battlefield...etc). For the sci-fi part, the poor scientific base doesn't worry me a lot as it succeeded to deliver the message of how dangerous and destructive it can be. Definitely a great movie worth watching!

Nolan's last haunting masterpiece is an impressive allegory about ambition, sacrifice, arrogance, obsession, titanic effort to go beyond natural limits and to challenge God. Nietzsche "Ubermensch" concept is embodied in the fight between these two Victorian-Age magicians, as well as the conflict between science and wizardry, instinct and rationality, respect of the rules and compulsive intention to go beyond good and evil. When you go out of the cinema, you think about the inner sense of this movie again, and again, and again... Great emotions, great plot (a sort of Greek tragedy!), great meta-reflection about perception, theories of mind, and psychological blindness: a great movie. Abracadabra!

In the beginning i was reluctant about this movie but the director drive my mind to the theatre because i'm a big fan of memento. I left the movie just like a zombie with a million concept ideas about the story. It's a Masterpiece with a solid acting and a wonderful and intelligent screenplay. Christopher Nolan was the great magician with the real prestige in the end of the movie. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale divide the master role of this game of ambition, Michael Cane the mentor of both. They will deceive us with mind tricks, they will fool our minds with illusions about the story.If you love movies that splinters your mind don't loose this outstanding work of art.

I don't know if this has been mentioned in any other post or not, but I was quite intrigued at the initials of the two protagonists - Alfred Borden (AB) and Robert Angier (RA). Abracadabra also happens to be the last word that Bale's character utters. I think Olivia summarized it beautifully when she said 'You two belong to each other'. Angier and Borden are in fact, two sides of the same coin. In fact, they are very much like the coin trick that Borden pulls on that young kid - two sides are the same. This aspect is emphasized by the fact that one gets shot in the hands, another hurts his leg, one a showman, the other the more talented magician. They actually complete each other.

Certainly one of the darker, yet more interesting films of the year, The Prestige sets out to tell a story full or originality and intrigue. Magic is a hard subject to resist. There is a part within all of us that has an avid curiosity and need to know how to explain the unexplainable. Of course, once it's revealed, almost all interest is lost, and it seems it's time to move onto the next thing. The Prestige tells a lot. I won't venture too far for fear of giving too much away, but while much is revealed in this film, there is still a lot to scratch your head over as the final credits roll (to a magnificent Thom Yorke song I might add). Yes, The Prestige has all the elements that keep your head spinning. Is it good? Yes. Will it stay with you? Yes. I'm just not sure I want that much darkness to follow me home.The Prestige, (like The Illusionist also released this year) is another thriller about 19th-century stage magicians with secrets which advances so far beyond its recent predecessor that only the subject matter entices me to mention them in the same sentence. Credit lies with director Christopher Nolan, who approaches his projects with a dark vision that I find wholly appealing. He wanders through the shadows of human desire and ambition, coloring his observations with sarcastic wit that staves off the despair to which they might otherwise succumb. Showbiz illusion makes a natural fit for Nolan. He understands as few others how much film has in common with it -- and Christopher Priest's source novel sets a story uniquely suited to his sensibilities. It centers on the bitter antagonism between two rival performers, once friends apprenticed under the same man, but now poisoned by jealousy and reproach. Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) is a master of technique, grasping sleight-of-hand mechanics with unparalleled insight. Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) is less physically adept, but makes up for it with supremely charismatic stage presence. This is something that his counterpart never quite got the hang of. Both have good reason to despise one another. Borden's arrogance once triggered an accident that cost Angier dearly, leading to an act of vengeance that threatened to cripple Borden's performing abilities for good. The two survived and went on to successful careers, but the seeds of hate were planted deep, and now the good things in their lives mean nothing when compared to the prospect of destroying each other.The interesting and visually brilliant technique that Nolan uses in keeping your interest in by enticing you with his abstract, and sharp color, as well as reminding you that if you look away, you might miss something--and certainly you might. As the film trails on, you are left to develop theories and ideas, knowing full well that your guess is as good as the person sitting next to you. There are jump cuts, quick edits, and long meditative shots on such beautiful starlets as Scarlett Johansson. This may be Nolan's technique for distraction as the background may very well be giving you the big reveal. The plot grows intensely complicated (the posters aren't kidding when they admonish you to watch closely) and sometimes strains credibility (fake beards come into play a little too often), but faithful viewers will be richly rewarded by the clever ingenuity on display.Nolan keeps it all together with the same tricks that have made his previous films so enjoyable: clever story development and focus upon character. Like Memento, The Prestige utilizes a complex editing style, cutting back and forth between eras to create a cinematic texture of misdirection and revelation (high regards should also go to editor Lee Smith for an extraordinary job). The results draw us close to the central figures, then let us watch in rapt fascination as their wounds and desires drag them down. A few problems and inconsistencies do arise -- places where plausibility strains or the twists become repetitive -- but like the characters on-screen, Nolan is so good at guiding our attention elsewhere that we soon forget such problems. His leading men give him plenty of help. Bale's knack for evoking the dark side is well established, but it's sublime watching Jackman turn his immense charm towards sinister ends (this is easily his best film performance to date). Both make excellent use not only of their characters' strengths, but also their fears and insecurities, which retain an ounce of humanity even as they seek new parts of their souls to sell.There is a lot to here to be creeped out by, especially when the end comes around. The darkness became so overwhelming to me that I had a hard time shaking it soon after. It made me fearful again of what humans are capable of and reminded me that there is still much to be learned about the dark side of the human psyche. The Prestige does earn high praise not just as a terrific historical thriller, but also because it grasps the medium's links to this subject so remarkably well -- just like Welles, Hitchcock, Wilder and all those other great filmic magicians whose ranks Nolan is well on his way to joining.

I heard from a friend who saw this that this was the most brilliant made movie she had ever seen, and she couldn't seem to emphasize that enough. That was enough to get me to see it in the theater (which i rarely do). This was easily worth the price of admission. The plot line is genius and keeps the viewer guessing what will happen next. Even if you guess one of the twists in this movie, you will probably find that you overlooked 1 or 2 more that you didn't see coming at all! This movie was so good, I went to the theater two days later and saw it again. It's wonderful the second time, too. Maybe about as good as the first time. I noticed more and more very smart aspects of the movie the second time that I didn't catch the first. I didn't know it was a Christopher Nolan film (Memento, Batman Begins) until after I watched it, which didn't surprise me as his work has always impressed me in the past, and continues to. If you haven't yet seen this, go see it!!! you wont regret it!

This was the first time I've been to the movies in a long time. I wasn't really planning on seeing this until a week before it came out when I saw it's trailer and me and my cousin thought it looked pretty cool.The movie never really gets boring at all. It is very clever. However, I must say that unless you pay extreme attention-as if it were a magic trick-you will be very confused. This movie cuts back and forth and goes all over the place. I mean, you really have no clue what it all means until the end...when they explain it.Apart from that, this is a wonderful movie. Christian Bale and Hugh Jack man are two of the greatest actors I've ever seen. And Christopher Nolan is one of the best directors I've ever seen. He was able to take a film that could have been boring and stupid and made it into an awesome film. I mean, while watching a magic show is cool, a movie based on how magic tricks are done doesn't sound very appealing to me. However, this movie proves that wrong and gives the audience an exciting ride.Because of the language and a few sexual references, I would not recommend this movie for children under the age of 10. But even if you are a parent who doesn't care about that stuff, your child is likely to fall asleep because he won't understand a single thing that is going on.There is always that point in the year that starts in August and goes all the way through the end of October, that not one appealing movie comes out. At least, not for me. Well, as we move into the Christmas season, the movies are starting to get better and better, and I'm sure more reviews will start coming in. This movie was the perfect movie to kick off this new season of good movies. If they keep getting better, the Oscars will be very tough.

Oh where do i begin! I knew this is a good movie. I knew it is gonna be tricky. So i watched tentatively from the start, and i just couldn't blink or exhale. This is one good movie and definitely worth the money to watch.The story is unique, different and very interesting. Not only about magic and complicated tricks. It is also about the complex human emotions that are beautifully portrayed by a great cast. Acting form each individual was very convincing. There were few moments when camera movement was a little irritating and unstable, but all in all.. close to perfect.In short, the movie is interesting and is like nothing i have seen before. It is definitely worth watching in the cinema... may be twice. And it is definitely worth buy the DVD. I hope they will make a presentable box set for this great movie.

Magic tricks and cinema share a lot of properties with each other in several ways, the two biggest being the way of leading an audience along towards a surprise and focusing the audience on a distraction while using sleight of hand to conjure up something surprising. They both have a long history in perceptions, demons, and the occult. They're both logical when revealed, and yet despite such revealing audiences are willing to return to see a show over and over and over again.These days it's no special deal to try and trick the audience... Mr. Shyamalan has decided to permanently affix his career to it. Unfortunately, sometimes the attempt to out-dazzle the audience (and thus sell tickets) leads in a lack of performance from the magicians responsible. In this case, however, everyone throws in their due and we're treated to a stage that's absolutely magical.I've never previously understood why people put so much stock into Christian Bale--I saw that he was good but I didn't think he was fantastic--until now. I'd say he's the sole reason to go see this movie, if it wasn't for Hugh Jackman's acting. I can't speak of either in terms of actor/supporting actor... there is no difference between their importance, and this movie is so full of doppelgangers you might as well just sit back and be prepared to see double. The two of them are amazing.Nolan has definitely evolved as a director and shows it here with a much more hidden role. He's definitely the Man behind the Curtain and not self-conscious in his directing, and this film's use of broken chronology is much more structurally sound than Memento and other out-of-order works. In this case, its hardly noticeable--I only realized that I didn't have difficulty following the plot back and forth AFTER I left the theatre.And the stage in which this movie is set is spectacular as well. The world is enticing with its intrigue and the many obsessive characters; I especially like the side story about Tesla and Edison, one that's only hinted at but that a short research into history of electricity will help reveal more depth to this already double-deep movie. David Bowie as Tesla was an odd choice... I hardly even noticed it was he.It's a very enjoyable movie and pretty spectacular in its own right.--PolarisDiB

The best kinds of movies are movies that will make you think and that you'll continue to talk about even after the picture ends, I went with my family and we talked about the movie even days after it ended, We're definitely going to go and see it again, it's a complete delight and will keep you on the edge of your seat even though it's a very long movie. There are so many plot twists and it will keep your mind spinning long after you finish watching it again, and once you see it you'll want to see it over and over again. I had no idea that this was previously a book and now I'm desperate to read it. Bale, Jackman and Johansen are wonderful actors and did a speldid job with their characters, giving them depth and three dimentions you'll have trouble deciding who to root for!

Christopher Nolan's previous films show him to be a master of plotting and misdirection, even in a relatively straightforward superhero film like "Batman Begins." Here, with Batman and Wolverine headlining his production (Batman, amusingly, plays a character named Alfred), he weaves another elaborate mystery set in Victorian Britain, as two stage magicians vie for prominence (when I first heard about this film, it reminded me of the novel "Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell", which was set in the Regency). Bale and Jackman bring little trace of their previous roles (especially Jackman), and have able support from Michael Caine, Scarlett Johanssen (in a rather throwaway part), and Rebecca Hall. However, the real surprise of the film is an astonishing performance from David Bowie as inventor Nikola Tesla; Bowie is incredible in this part, and one almost wishes for a movie about him. Much like a J.K. Rowling novel, the delight of this movie is the way in which Nolan scatters numerous clues to what is really going on through the proceedings, only to pull out a series of fantastic plot twists the cast a whole new light on everything we've see happen previous to this. There are several huge twists at the end of this film, any one of which alone would seem to be enough, until Nolan contorts the plot again, and things still hold together. I highly recommend this stellar production.

When I first went into the theater, it was to see "Employee of the Month," however I am really glad I chose to see "The Prestige" instead. This movie can be a little confusing at times, but it makes a lot of sense at the very end. It includes several plot twists and is a thought- compelling movie. My friend and I discussed "The Prestige" for at least a half hour. The plot is very good. The only flaw with this movie was that it could become confusing because of the time shifts. The time-jumps were needed in order to inform the viewer of the entire story, but it can leave a few people feeling confused. I don't really wanna expose the ending, which is why I'm not writing much about the plot. The actors' performances were great, and they included a lot of passion in their work. I would definitely say that if you've got money to go see a movie, "The Prestige" should be on your list, if not #1.

I heard someone say that he wished the special effects were better but that was not what this movie was about. I thought they were very good considering the years in which it took place. I hoped until the end...I thought they were very clever but so misguided. Both actors were so good, so cold. The decors were splendid, nothing to overwhelm the eyes, so we could stay focused on the story. Aahhh! The story!!! I will not comment on it, it was very well done. Some tricks still keep me guessing but the story was very well laid out.Rebecca Hall was incredible (don't know her) but Scarlett was bland (sorry, very pretty but bland)and Piper Perabo was very good, livelier. And Michael Caine!!! Oh Wow!! I expected the usual but not this.A mind is a tricky thing and I always say "Great minds think alike", well in this case, it was true. The greatness was in their wickedness and deception power and none could enjoy the power they had. They could not even take pleasure from it.But don't take my comment from granted and make your own opinion.

Without a doubt one of the best movies I have seen in recent years. where to begin? Surprisingly the best performance I thought came from David Bowie as the émigré to America N. Tesla. His struggles with English were the only governor to his genius. All the rest Bale,Jackman performed very well. I would give the edge to Bale as he perhaps had the more challenging role. Michael Caine comes to each role now with an accumulation of experience that makes his performances as taken for granted as richly designed tapestry unnoticed until you consciously examine the weave,cut,and design. Perhaps the only disappointment as far as acting goes is from Scarlet Johannson's performance although in looks as always she is a delight for the eyes. Obviously,to say too much about the movie risks spoiling it. The concept was original. The movie itself 'mirrors' the three parts of a magic trick. Needless to say the third part of the movie "the prestige will not disappoint. Bill Hash

The Prestige was incredibly well-made, and I for one was thoroughly entertained. There's so much to analyze and pick apart with this movie that I'll probably be talking about it for the next month. I'm not going to waste time with much of a synopsis or spoiler. The movie works best I think the less you know about it going in. Just know that The Prestige is about an obsessive rivalry between two great magicians. Also, you should know that the writing was crisp and clever (must have been quite a chore to adapt), the directing was masterful (the structure of this movie is just as complicated as Momento-probably more so) and the acting (particularly Christian Bale) was spot-on. Highly recommended, particularly if you like Nolan's other films.

I saw flags of our fathers, what i consider to be a very mediocre film, but as far as the reviews have been going this past week, it's virtually the only film i knew had come out. I saw a preview for The prestige and decided to go, and I was so glad i did. Besides the flawless acting and triumphantly consistent tone, the movie strikes on you on a few different levels. It portrays all aspects of our lives in general-- our sacrifices and the prestige we sacrifice for. What are you willing to give up for greatness? GO SEE THIS FILM! I have not been satisfied by a film in so very long, although i recently saw the departed which was indeed a kickass film, but Nolan's style is so magnificent-- its totally encaptivating, and I just had so much fun at this movie.

Probably a well crafted plot, but awfully confusing visually because of the "twins" that appear intermittently.The cinematography is top notch, and actors are decent, so it's a quality piece no doubt, but I didn't like the story (at all). There were more sadistic meanness in each of the characters that escalated from around the middle of the movie, and then continued to no end until its (trashy) ending. I don't care if one was smarter than the other or outwitted the other. The ugliness of the confrontation got appalling to a point where intrigue didn't matter anymore. I also didn't like the audio, how sudden blast of sound got injected to make you jump up from your seats. I know it's digital, and I know that theaters have mega watt systems, but is it really necessary to crank up the volume so loud suddenly ?Nice to watch visually, but the characters and the story that goes with it were unpalatable.

SERIOUS SPOILERS and RANTS!!!! (For The Prestige AND The Illusionist) I just don't understand it--I've read the reviews of this movie here on Amazon and only one other person seems to also feel that the movie was ridiculously predictable early on. The clues were in your face, and then repeated/flaunted/displayed over and over, ad nauseum. Then, to add insult to injury on top of the old hackneyed "twin theme," some pseudoscience is thrown in to boot (clones created "Highlander" style--absurd bolts of electricity and all--Star Trek did cloning better in the 60's with Kirk on the whirly machine thing for God's sake). So Jackman's character kills himself/his clones over and over during every show waiting for the one time when Bale's character goes backstage, consequently pinning Jackman's murder on him. At the end they "divulge" the big secret that Bale has a twin (DUH?), and then the last scene shows Jackman floating in a tank and we're all supposed to go--wha? I mean wasn't it obvious that Jackman was killing himself over and over? (Or were all those hats and cats just extraneous props to throw us off?) And the Lord is...who?...is it really Hugh Jackman? Geez I didn't see that one coming...only A MILE AWAY. People keep comparing this movie to The Illusionist, but I thought the ending of The Illusionist was equally insulting--I mean, Paul Giamatti had to recount all the steps leading to the "secret" of the movie, when it was really obvious early on what had happened. I can only see Ed Norton, who was fantastic in Down in the Valley (as a dubious/not b&w character that kept you thinking) in the edit room arguing, "What? Why do we have to spoon feed the audience?" (Wasn't this "recap" device used already in Usual Suspects anyway?--only in Usual Suspects it was effective and necessary--at the end of the movie you really do go "ah ha! I didn't see that coming! Simply brilliant.") Christian Bale was incredible in The Machinist and American Psycho (even Batman was interesting). He has the charisma of a rock in The Prestige. Michael Caine is...basically Michael Caine. Hugh Jackman--he IS Wolverine. In this movie he falls flat. I don't feel his anger. I should want Bale's character incinerated for what he did, though maybe inadvertently, to Jackman's wife. But I don't feel anything. I've been a fan of Scarlett since Ghost World. No extraordinary acting here though. David Bowie, however, (whether he looks like the real Tesla or not) was very engaging. I wanted to see more of him. Oh well. I give it two stars just because I love the actors, though not in this particular movie.

Worst script ever!!! Worst scenario ever!!! The plot is total nonsense!!! Only the performance of the actors is awesome. This movie has total lack of common sense. The ending is complete nonsense! I do not want to write spoilers here explaining the situation, but I have to - just ask yourself - if the machine was able to produce clones why Robert Anger was killed? And he also was betrayed without any reason by two people - his assistant Olivia and his friend Cutter. Does anybody want to explain why? This is more fiction than that Tesla machine - friends usually do not betray with no reason... I did not enjoy this movie because of a huge lack of a common sense...

There is nothing profound or interesting about this movie. It is choppy and confusing, and seems like it drags on forever. It has long series of plot holes instead of a plot. The two main characters are neither interesting nor likable. The main premise (which leads to the great "denouement" at the end) is not only obvious, it's ridiculous. The movie says nothing about ambition or the quest for perfection or any of the other deep stuff people pretend to see in it. It's about a couple of guys so consumed by mutual hatred and envy that they can't seem to get a life of their own. This movie makes The Illusionist seem plausible and coherent by comparison. A waste of talent, especially Michael Caine's.

!!CONTAINS SPOLERS!!! One of the worst films I have seen in a while. Multiple mean-spirited characters doing nasty things to one another for over two hours does not constitute a good story. The only message I could possibly see here was that mean poor people should triumph over mean rich people. There was not one character that I felt any sympathy or empathy for by the end of the film. They all double crossed each other and sold each other out repeatedly. On top of that, the film makers double crossed the audience, by strategically leaving things out only to reveal the true facts of various interactions later on just to fool the viewer. How could anyone walk away from this feeling even okay, much less good, about the film? The high rating it is getting is an absolute amazement to me. The trend in films now seems to be if you can have enough screwy twists to keep the audience thinking about the twists, character development, moral lessons, decent plots and story lines don't need to exist. This really took off with "The Sixth Sense" (which was actually a pretty decent movie)and continues to be the trend. There have been a few good films with interesting plot twists but the popularity of misdirection just for its own sake has gotten completely out of hand.I wish the movie going public would stop rewarding these kind of lame efforts and pay more attention to the important elements of story telling. Like having at least one or more characters that you can empathize with at least a little bit. Or things like a story that doesn't have to have some bizarre deus ex machina to make it work.I may be living in a fantasy world, but one can at least hope.UPDATE 05-29-2008 - I like the actors in this film so much I gave it a second chance. Going in with lowered expectations after my first viewing helped, and I actually found myself enjoying the journey of the characters. The story itself is actually not bad just ambigous. I have to admit, even though I don't exaclty love this movie, it was not as bad as I initlially thought. Still not one I would highly recommend, but alright for late night cable TV fare.

Well, I've been interested in cinematography for the past 10 years of my life, I've watched all kinds of movies and I always seek the best, and please remember this is just my opinion...I watched the movie expecting something HUGE after all that hype, and I have to say, I couldn't be more disappointed, the twists were so clear from the beginning, the whole story seemed so trivial to me, it really doesn't deserve the hype or the high rating it got, although I couldn't say anything but "Brilliant" about the acting, that was the highlight of the whole thing, the directing was just "Decent" at most, and the make up was "Horrible".I gave this movie 5/10 only for the acting, the clothing and the decoration.

I came to see this movie with very high hopes, but came away severely disappointed. In an age where it seems every movie has to have a 'surprise ending' this is no different from many other movies out there at the moment. I guess the bulk of my criticism comes from the fact that I guessed the plot of the film, together with its two theorethically surprise twists at the end about 20 minutes (Tesla exhibition + multiple top-hats in the first scenes of the movie) and 40-45 minutes into the movies (Borden gravediggin'). From then on it was just waiting and saying to myself 'That was so obvious'. At fault is the director and scriptwriter who seemed to throw to much apparent clues too soon in the movie.Chris Bale does I must say a spectacular job as Borden, with Hugh Jackman supplying a satisfying if indifferent performance. The biggest flop was the babe meaning Scarlett Johannson, who seems to think the only thing necessary to act is to show some skin and to pucker up her seductive lips.I especially find flaw with the whole premise of the story... if you do a magic film you take one of three routes to make it coherent and with some cohesive background.A) You include real magic making the story more mystical; B) You put into the movie unexplainable events and leave it to the audience to decide if the magic is real or false; C) You show that everything is a trick, although the tricks are so ingenious that they add a certain punch to the movie.YOU DON'T DO SOMETHING WHICH IS A BIT OF THIS OR A BIT OF THAT making it in a muddled incoherent mess. Unfortunately all solutions to the movie were basically the easiest solutions, meaning that the scriptwriters (novelist?) really didn't try to hard to think of more surprising alternatives to the story.The end solutions were apparent from a mile away, the Scarlett role was dismal and all in all the story very much unimpressive. Giving these factors even though I absolutely love "Memento" and congratulate Nolan on "Batman Begins" I have to give my thumbs down and a 3/10 (with one point added for Christian Bale's portrayal).

This had a lot of potential and the same tricks as batman begins. The dreary landscapes and overt use of dull colors to make to movie more sombre than it actually is. If I didn't know better I would guess that Nolan had a gay affair with Christian bale. Bale needs to overcome his lisp( speech impediment) and his 1 dimensional acting. The plot is predictable and sometimes you are tricked to think that there could be more than the obvious, but that feeling is ephemeral. British accents are laughable and the premise of Tesla inventing duplicating machines is an challenging ones intelligence. The Nolans need to ease up on the toke and think of something less inane. I'm afraid that the people who were awed by this insipid movie need to increase their cognitive capabilities.

After reading the reviews had high hopes but to be honest very disappointed. Good cast and well acted but the twists and turns never really happened.... I had already guessed the outcome and you don't have to be a genius!

A film about magicians, and of course magicians make a business tricking people. Usually, though, the audience doesn't figure out the trick, and that's why it works. Unfortunately here the trick is laid bare and it makes the whole thoroughly disappointing. There is much more promised than delivered, and I find it hard to recommend to anyone. Part of the disappointment is that it could have been so much more. The premise is interesting, the characters start out interesting... as is, though, it needs a major rewrite. Sorry.

If I were to judge this movie just on the quality of the acting and the beauty of the photography, costumes, set design, and even 90% of the dialog, this would get 9 stars. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to people who go to the movies to see a spectacular looking period piece. Jackman and Bale do superb jobs as the centerpieces of the film's story, the supporting case is dead on (including Michael Caine - which didn't surprise me - and David Bowie - which did).But the ambitious screenplay is so riddled with sloppy plotting and unfair plot devices that it almost sinks the film.I can appreciate the difficulty of what Nolan and Nolan are trying to pull off here, and I am familiar with the work of Christopher Priest (who wrote the novel the screenplay is based on). But, simply put, the screenplay cheats like a bastard. It promises us an amazingly clever game of cat-and-mouse between two gifted and obsessive geniuses. It promises us a dazzling resolution which will astound us with its deviousness and cause us to slap our foreheads in delight, because we "should have seen it coming". (Kind of like some of the old "Columbo" episodes). ***GENERAL SPOILERS FOLLOW*** Instead it presents an out-of-left-field plot development that is completely unjustified by what went before, lies to us about the premises of another plot device that it then uses to drive the entire latter portion of the movie, and presents us with a couple of protagonists who are morally repellent and seemingly dumber than rocks.***DETAILED SPOILERS FOLLOW****I don't want to waste your time (and mine) detailing all the ways the screenplay fouls up, but I will mention a couple.1) If Angier is so devastated by his wife's death in the stage accident early in the movie (as a result of Bordon's "carelessness" in tying the knots), and has such a need for vengeance, it seems to be that he ought to save at least SOME of his wrath for his friend Cutter, who designed the water tank in the first place. How hard would it have been to make one of the glass sides in the water tank thin enough (say, the one in the back that the audience couldn't see directly) so that it could be broken with one swing of a sledge in an emergency? How hard would it have been to TEST the tank when it was full to see how long it actually took to break it? For that matter, how hard would it have been to train Angier's wife to hold her breath for 3 minutes - a feat any stage magician and illusionist learns very early in his career? Any of these precautions would have saved the women's life when things went wrong, yet Angier blames Borden alone.2) Early on, trying to solve the puzzle of Borden's great trick "The Transported Man", Angier and Cutter discard the possibility that Borden is using a look-a-like because Angier's new assistant claims that the "double" also has mutilated fingers, and no double could duplicate Borden's mutilated fingers. That's not valid reasoning. Times back then were tough enough that people routinely mutilated themselves so they could pass as cripples to beg for money, and women prostituted themselves for small change. Plenty of people back then (and even now) would jump at the chance to trade two fingers for a steady income and financial security. OK, I'll buy it if the film insists...these are supposed to be the smartest guys in their field, after all...BUT: What do you know! It turns out that Borden not only uses a look-a-like after all, he has a TWIN who submitted to having his fingers mutilated! I got so angry when I saw this that I nearly walked out of the theater.That's cheating - it's not clever and magician-like at all....it's just the act of an obsessive creep who doesn't have the skill or the wit to live up to the art of deception and misdirection that is supposed to be the stage magician's reason for being. Most of all, it doesn't live up to the premise that drove the latter half of the screenplay - that he's not using a double because a double wouldn't have mutilated fingers.Similarly, Angier spends years and a fortune (where'd the money come from? The movie mostly shows us performances that end in disaster!) trying to solve Borden's "Transported Man" trick...instead of actually simply trying to come up with a BETTER trick. The guy is supposed to be this "brilliant" stage magician, and yet all he can do is copy another guy's act?? Does ANYone buy this? I've just scratched the surface here: Problems and psychological inconsistencies and morally repulsive actions riddle the movie from beginning to end...not the least of which ***BIG SPOILER FOLLOWS!**** is when the Nolan brothers choose to pull a freak science fiction plot device out of nowhere in what was an interesting period mystery piece and character study. Wait a minute - the whole premise of the film is the secrecy and mystery of illusion and stagecraft. To pull a trick off with HARD SCIENCE (no matter how impressive) is to basically say, "Nope, these characters suck, and we aren't smart enough to make our premise work. Sorry, hope you like the new direction!!" If the acting weren't so good, if most of the dialog wasn't so spot on, if the movie didn't look so brilliant, I'd slam "The Prestige" non stop to everyone I know. And yet I STILL like it enough to rank it as a "7" when the plot barely merits a "4". As it is, I have to advise the first time viewer to suspend his critical thinking facilities and just drink in the mood.

Many stories strive on love. Occasionally, you'll find some that feed on hate, such as Wuthering Heights. The Prestige is a story that feeds on gnawing hate. Set at the turn of the century, two young assistants to a magician called Cutter (Michael Caine) start out as pals, but turn into bitter enemies and rivals when a mistake (we never know if that's intentional) committed by one causes the death of the other's wife during a performance. Borden (Christian Bale) goes off by himself, gets married and has a lovely daughter while Angier (Hugh Jackman) stays with Cutter while nursing a bitter hatred for Borden for causing the death of his wife.With Christopher Nolan ("Memento") at the helm, you can be assured that the story is not told in a simple linear fashion. Indeed, the deft narration, in no less than three time spans, is one of the joys from watching the movie. While a little confusing at the beginning, the full picture gradually unfolds before our eyes  how Borden, accused of the murder of Angier, is waiting in jail for the gallows (the present), how Angier goes to Colorado to seek out Borden's secret (the less distant past) and how the rivalry of the two developed in the first place (the more distant past). In the process, we are also shown how they both fall in love with a beautiful stage assistant Olivier, played by the underused Scarlett Johansson.Although the twist in this movie is not really its highlight, it deserves mentioning. While enough twists and sledge-of-hand have been provided to keep the movie interesting throughout, the key theme is always there, depending on how much attention you pay. The clue is the Chinese magician's trick, which requires not only a moment's deception on stage, but an entire lifetime's charade on and off stage. That is the key. Added to that is something I, as a faithful follower of Sherlock Holmes, always have at the back of my mind - "If you eliminate all the possibilities, whatever remains, however improbable, is the solution".But the beauty of this movie, as I said, is not the story and plot twist, but the way it is presented. Again, this is an idea that has been explored in the movie. While Borden is a better magician, he does not have the packaging skills and stage presence of Angier. Nolan, on the other hand, certainly have what it takes to make magic out of an otherwise somewhat uninspired story and less than brilliant plot twists. He is helped by excellent art direction (particularly the Gothic set) and crisp editing that sustains a compelling pace without losing the necessary details.Performance of the two male leads shine, in different ways. Jackman has the advantage of a dashingly handsome face, which seems to bring out his best whether it's a 17th century nobleman, a vampire exterminator, or a werewolf. And he does have the stage presence required of Angier. Christian Bale is the sort of actor that does not impress at first glance, but grows on you. Once he gets into the dark side of Borden and unleashes the ominous latent energy, you'll appreciate how difficult a role it is and how well he has tackled it. While Johansson is underused, Caine demonstrates each and every time that he is the most reliable actor around today when an anchor is required for the entire movie. Quite a few people comment on David Bowie playing the eccentric inventor, but I think equally deserving is Andy Serkis who plays his assistant. While most would not recognize he face, I cannot fail to, having watched repeatedly the extended DVD of Lord of the Rings  Andy Serkis, the man who is Gollum.

The Prestige is seriously the best movie I've ever seen! Hugh Jackman, Scarlett Johansson, and Rebecca Hall did GREAT acting, however, Christian Bale should win BEST ACTOR! I've enjoyed his performances in previous films like American Psycho and The Machinist, but he deserves special recognition for his role in this movie. If you don't see this film,you are missing out on a great story, with great actors, and an awesome directing job by Christopher Nolan. I was pleasantly surprised to see David Bowie and Andy Serkis in the film and they played their roles PERFECTLY. Michael Cain adds a great deal to the stability and credibility to the main characters and as always does a fine job acting. This is certainly a MUST SEE!

I really loved this movie and can not even really think of anything else to compare it to. It's just so dark and edgy, it reminds me of a cross between early Tim Burton and David Fincher in its delivery. So mystical but still connected with reality and powerful. I think I'm still recovering...The acting is excellent, Bale is solidifying himself as one of the best actors out there, Jackman's great, and I like the fact that Scarlett Johanssen's role in the film clearly was not expanded just because she signed on, her presence only adds to the film without trying to be bigger than the story.I would highly recommend this movie and have to say that this movie, along with a few other recent releases (Science of Sleep, Departed, etc) is an encouraging sign of where the movie industry is headed...

Christopher Nolan is incredible at creating suspense. This movie is all about secrets; secrets between friends, secrets between enemies, and secrets from the audience. As Nolan seems to like to do in his movies, he does a great job of keeping the audience out of the loop and always a step behind. When good directors make a few good movies, it's easy to slip along the way. Each new movie they make is another chance for them to fail, and people start to anticipate these failures because they hold each new film to a higher standard than the previous one. He hasn't disappointed me yet.The acting is well done. I don't think anyone would expect a poor performance from Michael Cane, Christain Slater, or Scarlett Johanson, and they definitely didn't achieve anything less than expected. Hugh Jackman proves to be a talented actor in an artistic film, not just a high budget Hollywood production.

Let me commence my abridgment by stating that this movie is one to remember--it's a masterpiece. It left me with curiosity every minute of the movie. Contrary to other movies, the twists and turns cannot be anticipated. This is truly worth the eight dollar student ticket, and it would not leave you with regrets. This movie is a must! I am no critic, but this movie would be "two thumbs way up." In comparison to his other wonderful movies, Batman Beins and Momento, i would say this is the best. And i must admit Batman Begins was one outstanding movie. The acting in the movie reflects the "old" times. The plot was well written and nothing was flawed. If you plan to watch a movie, i would recommend this one.

Honestly, I felt like Iv'e been treated like a baby
Boring!!(and highly overrated)
I guess the high score comes from the ignorance of the majority

After seeing that this film is in the IMDb top 100, I thought it was a film I must see. Now that I've seen it, I feel a bit disappointed. Now I must admit that the film was terribly original and had some odd twists, though the film overall is awfully grim and lifeless--mostly because it was hard connecting with the characters.Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman play magicians who are partners. Things go very well for a while until Jackman's wife is accidentally killed doing a dangerous trick. Jackman blames Bale for this and you really can't tell if Bale did anything wrong or if it was just a sad tragedy. Regardless, Jackman spends the rest of the film persecuting Bale and trying to destroy him. After a while, Bale begins fighting back and it's an all-out war with horrible consequences. I won't say more--because I don't want to spoil the film. However, I will say that it gets really, really, really weird when Nicola Tesla (played very well by David Bowie) enters the fray--creating the ultimate magical box for Jackman.Aside from the magic box being ridiculously anachronistic, the film is so slow and hard to love--despite it's wonderful twists. It's hard to like either of the magicians (particularly Jackman) and after a while I lost interest--mostly because of the pacing and disagreeable characters. Overall, I greatly respect the film but also didn't particularly enjoy watching it.

Okay, well I'd been looking forward to this movie, the premise sounded great, Victorian magician's competing with each other for the 'trick they'll be remembered for'... I've got time for the entire cast, and in my opinion they pretty much all turned in great performances... but i'm still a little unsure of how worthwhile this movie really is.*spoilers*so, the movie seems to centre itself around a clever trick 'The Transported Man' - which, although at points is described as nothing more than an illusion created with a magicians double, it's also suggested that Nikola Tesla invented a machine that would not just duplicate objects.. but would perfectly duplicate PEOPLE?!okay, i'm of two opinions, either:A) the machine doesn't work = a clever, ingenious movie that i've yet to fully suss.or B) the machine does work = a naff work of fiction that pivots on an, as yet, impossible piece of technology.now aside from the mass of arguments going on in the forums, i'm lead to believe that Nolan has created a film with a *working* machine, this is nothing new, many a hopeless whodunit has cropped up an impossible-to-figure killer in the final real. or, like the prestige, has relied on some bit of gadgetry that turns the entire reality of the movie into a farce... Scream3 springs to mind with the 'voice changer' that'll change anyone's voice into anyone else's.it's about magicians... normal people, creating something mystical, with no more than skill and misdirection... whereas this movie has a normal man, creating a truly mystical effect, with a hugely preposterous work of fiction... if he can invent a 'duplicating' machine back in the Victorian times, then why not just have all the magicians as wizards as well, if you're gonna leap into fantasy, then leap with your whole being, not just plop it in at the end as a silly fix-it.here's hoping someone makes a movie of 'Carter Beats The Devil' instead, set around the same time, with a far more plausible storyline, and characters you really learn to care about.then again, if Nolan comes out in 5 years time and explains to us how the movie works with a *non-working* machine, then all is forgiven, and this is a damn good movie..... but until that day... 3/10

That quote is from Nikola Tesla himself, it's not from the dialog spoken by David Bowie as Tesla. But I think it summarizes what is wrong with The Prestige. The action of the movie centers around the nexus where science meets illusion, which is a fascinating avenue into metaphysics, but in this movie, the science is little more than elaborate window dressing to what boils down to a melodrama about the all-consuming hatred between two illusionists the 1890s, Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Borden (Christian Bale). I'm not a fan of reviews that say what filmmakers should have done. Better to judge artists on the choices that they did make in the writing, casting, production, etc., and how successful those choices were in the finished work. But The Prestige is particularly frustrating because the Nolan brothers are obviously talented men, and I'm convinced that they missed opportunities both large and small.First, the science: Besides including Nicola Tesla as character, there are two stagecraft engineers, Cutter (Michael Caine) and Fallon (Bale, disguised, in a dual role). Neither, unfortunately, add much to the story, which, again, boils down to a feud which is so vicious that both men end up handicapped.Second, a rather glaring flaw in the script: Angier is determined to duplicate Borden's most phenomenal trick, teleportation, which can be compared to Scotty beaming people from Point A to a nearby Point B. Angier's engineer, Cutter, deduces that Borden achieves the illusion by simply using a body double at Point B, but Angier stubbornly refuses to believe that, which drives the plot off the rails for two reasons: (1) Less believable than any magic trick, ever, Angier is promptly presented with his own exact lookalike--Gerald Root, an underemployed and drunken actor-- which is preposterous, and disappointing except that it gives us a double-dose of Hugh Jackman. (2) Cutter was right about Borden simply using a double (his twin, Fallon), but Angier has gone to Colorado to find Tesla, whom he employs, and the great Tesla actually invents a kind of teleportation that is more fantastic than Scotty's transporter: it not only transports, it clones. While the subject remains at Point A, a duplicate pops into existence at Point B.A stunning breakthrough, no? But it's used as just another magic trick.In the end, more disappointment for the viewer. Angier confesses that his motivation all along-- the driving passion of his life-- is nothing more than to bask in applause, so the whole feud boils down to Angier's rolling-in-it ego vs. Borden/Fallon's consummate duplicity. The women Borden and Fallon love don't even know there are two of them. Ultimately, both wives end up dead, and a shared mistress (Scarlett Johanssen) is so manipulated and betrayed that she scrams. The actual climax sinks to a horror-film tactic, with clones of Angier rotting in water tanks under the stage. That's followed by a pat Hollywood ending, where the covetous Angier dies, the resentful Fallon is hanged, and Borden walks off with one of the two surviving females, his daughter. Another quote, one spoken in the film by Bowie as Tesla, suggests how good this movie might have been, if it had been more about ideas than emotions. Speaking as a scientist to a magician, he says, "Perhaps you'll find more luck in your field, where people are happy to be mystified." That is where a potentially fascinating film could have been found, in a story about how illusionists ultimately rely on science and engineering, and when the science is revealed, the result is the end of confusion and the dawn of enlightenment. Getting it completely backwards, The Prestige exploits science in the service of illusion and insane rivalry.Their subject was magic. I only wish the Mssrs. Nolan weren't quite so guilty of misdirection.

As a guest at the world premier of this film, held at the El Capitan in Hollywood on October 17, 2006, I can say that not only did I enjoy it very much, but that the enthusiasm with which the audience received it seemed genuine and unaffected by the presence of those principals who attended.Among the many virtues of this film are the exquisite cinematography, the solid writing and story line, the respect with which magic is treated, and the fabulous acting. Michael Caine, to those paying attention, really steals the show with his characteristic understated mien.The presentation of magic is very well done; and the art of magic is obviously revered. As this reviewer understands it, the film was largely shot on a closed set, and only those who needed to be privy to how the actual magic effects were accomplished had access when those scenes were shot.The characters, for the most part, were three dimensional and their motives adequately justified their actions. If one could wish for more in this regard, it would be to have some more back-story on the leading characters.Which, as it happens, runs counter to my main criticism of this film: It is too long. It is too long by 15 or 20 minutes. Still, whence to cut those 15 or 20 minutes is very difficult to say. There is no one scene that, in retrospect, seems expendable. The paring might best be done one frame at a time; but however it is done, the film needs to be shorter.My only other criticisms of the film (and herein resides my spoiler) are that there is no explanation of how the Tesla device reproduces the object in its field, and neither is there an explanation of how the point at which the reproduction appears can be set. A minor criticism, because it could have been handled in one or two lines of dialog, is that Angier's (Hugh Jackman) dual consciousness is not explained. In fact, Cutter (Michael Caine) recounts a drowning story in such a way as to indicate that the transported Angier wouldn't know the agony of drowning. Yet the film briefly shows two Angiers simultaneously conscious, implying that both of them could have continued Angier's life with full access to his life's continuum.The film, although it tests the audience's ability to suspend disbelief, is rich enough overall to warrant a hearty recommendation. It will be an Oscar contender.

Anyone with taste shouldn't attend a film with either Jackman, Johansson, or Bale, or directed by Nolan. Anyone with a brain would have seen the end coming an hour before the end comes. Chopped-up editing. Confused narration. Historically inaccurate. Very long. Boring cinematography. Studio movie 100 percent. Something has to blow up every 5 minutes to please the audience. The makers don't know if they're directing fiction or historical period piece. Maybe the only thing to save from the film is Bowie, walking through the screen like an alien-life form, with the same distinctive walk we have seen so many times in films (Twin Peaks, the Man Who Fell to earth, ...). David Lynch once wanted to make a film about Nikola Tesla, and Nolan asking Bowie to be him is maybe a nod to the project, but sadly it fails to portray anyone, or anything, in a convincing manner...And all this looks like it's been done and seen before a thousand times.

My personal all-time favorite movie, you might need several viewings to truly grasp its amazing narrative.

Every magic trick has 3 parts...This would be one of the most iconic lines of all time. I don't know if it's the brilliance of Nolan, the acting of Bale and Jackman or the presence of Caine that's made this movie the best movie of all time, for me at least. I'm thrilled to the bone everyone I watch it, which is like a million times!
The music makes it even more haunting. I may be dumb but I had to watch this movie like 10 times before I finally understood it. And each time I watch it I find something new in it. That's what brilliant movies are all about.
If I were younger and in another era, Id give up everything to be a magician.

Nolan has an incredible list of movies. Everyone knows about The Dark Knight (2008), Inception (2010) and Interstellar (2014) but it took a Nolan marathon to find this masterpiece.
The movie emanates the opening monologue; the first act being 'the pledge', promising that there is something interesting to come: the second act being 'the turn', making an ordinary whodunnit into a magical mystery: and finally the final and third act being 'the prestige', bringing back the idea in one of the best twists of a tale ever. The thing that sets this and fight club and the best plot twists is one the rewatch it can be seen but on the first time around you are none the wiser no movie does this better than the prestige as it just shows it the whole way through so subtly.
One of the best 2 handers in my opinion as both of the protagonists are equally the others antagonist making a brilliantly compelling story.
It has 2 of the greatest actors of this generation, and probably the best actress. Christian Bale is sublime as per, managing to show the multiple sides of his personality, to the point where you can guess when he is saying it (If you've seen it then you know, if not I don't want to spoil it) just from line delivery itself. Hugh Jackman is masterful in showing his discontent towards his counterpart and his professional quest to be the best. Scarlett Johanson brings an uncanny ability to create a sense of two faced-ness the characters requires. Top it with amazing supporting performances from the great Michael Caine, Rebecca Hall, David Bowie, Piper Perabo and Andy Serkis. And both Bale and Jackman play 2 roles each which is stunning. My only gripe with the acting is Scarlett Johansson's British accent. It's not very good in short.
This is probably Nolan's most drama-ry movie and least sci fi. He executes the mystery nature in a way that through the whole movie grips you making you want to know how to do it.
A complete story of twists and turns from the classic friends to enemy's movie
Must watch!

Christopher Nolan has created an incredibly suspenseful piece. I was on the edge of my seat. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are both playing such likeable sociopaths that I believe they should have been at least nominated for an academy award. Hats off to you Mr. Nolan

Honestly, I think I would need to watch it again to tell you whether I think it's a good movie or not. Of course, it's filled with such amazing actors and I really liked the mystery all along, but the thing is I think it is way too long. Although, I recommend it.

There no things impossible but we dont know the real behind it.

Let's just say, this is my all time favorite movie.

Brilliant Screenplay from the Nolan brothers.
Great direction from Chris Nolan himself along with Christian Bake's superb acting makes this a must watch

Magic and showmanship. Is it the craft that shines or the performance. The trick isn't has spectacular once you know the secret. A little bit of mystery can go a long way. Secrets and competition. Who's story is it anyway? I'm no stranger to the world of Christopher Nolan. This movie has been on my list for a long time. I wasn't let down. A lot of fun and thought provoking. Great watch.

Marvellous it is. I love this film. I've seen it a crazy number of times - maybe approaching 25 times. It's now on Netflix and so yes, on it comes. Again! And I'm thinking I'll just watch 10-20 mins, but I watch the entire thing again.For me, it's best Nolan film. Absolutely. No doubt. If you watch it. Watch it again! Please. No matter what your get out of it first time, you will always get more from this film. It's the trick that keeps giving.Enjoy.

The period, the actors, the plot, the writing. It's gold

Historical / thriller / fantasy film. It takes us back to the 19th century, to another era, where two young magicians are in their infancy. A fatal mistake of one in the other's wife, starts an eternal vendetta, something beyond than just competition. As the plot unfolds, the original incentive of the vendetta has been forgotten, there is only rivalry now, with no return. It also introduces us a vendetta behind the vendetta. So, apart from the vendetta of the two magicians, there is also the well-known Tesla-Edison vendetta and there the film gives some science fiction with a fiction Tesla device. A modest film, an extremely well-written script with 4 big twists, of which the 2 huge twists come one after the other at the end of the film, with excellent direction, great scenery and very good acting by Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson, one of the top Nolan films and one of the very best and remarkable films in general. Two men, one vendetta, The Prestige.

While a lot of other Christopher Nolan movies get more hype and credit, for my money this is his best film. Intricate, perfectly scripted and paced, with a solid cast and a satisfying and surprising ending, it's truly a marvel.Give it a go.

I've been watching the movie closely over and over again for years, but I'm still being fooled.

When discussing Christopher Nolan, this film rarely gets brought up --which is a shame! It's just such an enjoyable experience from start to finish and really shows off Nolan's strengths as a filmmaker. Spread the word!

This is one of the best movies I have ever seen, the plot twist at the end is one of the best I have ever seen. I recommend that you watch this film a second time because the second time is better than the first time because of all the foreshadowing.

Cuttle has said not to use a double that he can't control, that he can only kill one at a time if he wants perfect control, and he has also said he wants to swap places with the double, so the double dies and he appears to enjoy the cheer.Copying machines is also a scam from start to finish. Why is tesla leaving when the machine succeeds? Because he knew it couldn't be. Two magicians have been trying to atone for their hatred, just like magic deceiving the eyes, one keeps killing for it, and the other is schizophrenic for it.So they all ended up dead.

First things first; the acting is excellent by one and all, especially the great Michael Caine. The characters on the other hand were disgusting. The way these two behaved and the atrocities they committed made me wish they both died. The little girl should have been raised by Cutter. This movie made me sick to my stomach. Both characters were utterly demonic.

The Prestige is absolutely one of the best movies I've ever watched in my life. Christopher Nolan, never fails to amazes me. The unpredictability of the movie is very rare now in movies, a lot of plot twists, including Tesla. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman with their astonishing performances, beside of course the great Michael Caine. There will never be a movie alike, and I'll surely recommend this movie to everybody.

Man, whatever movie this guy makes it's a masterpiece. It's crazy how good he is. What an excellent script. Hugh, Christian and Michael rocked this one. I wish I had seen this in theaters.

It is a bit disappointing. I would rather spend ny time elsewhere

Whilst many appear to prefer The Illusionist, for me The Prestige provides a far deeper and darker exploration into the bitter rivalry between two magicians. The depths to which Bale and Jackman's characters stoop to exact revenge on one another whilst attempting to uncover each others secret results in a spectacular tale of intrigue, betrayal and murder. An encapsulating spectacle of cinematography which is deserving of much greater critical acclaim than it ever received.

Magic is the art that not allowed to be debunked. But Borden and Angier kept trying to debunk each other. Angier and Borden, one chose the inhuman technology and since then kept wondering whether he is real or a substitute, and the other chose the inhuman life, living two people into one person. In the values of this movie, the greatest sacrifice should be to endure the life, not to die. Once people get caught in the excessive obsession, it is equivalent to the active exposure of their weaknesses. Borden made use of Angier's obsession with magic to send him to the US. Angier made use of Borden's obsession to trick him into the background and completed his murder. In my opinion, when one's pursuit of art completely overrides one's love for life, the art is no longer art, and one's dedication is not worthy of praise.

The movie is really high quality and very realistic. It takes people away.

I've never been so much confused after watching any movie. This is the best one. After ending I tried to arrange & relate those twists one after another. Moreover I have go through & repeat some scenes for 5-10 times. But I became more hanged! What was the truth? Who was true? It's all about magic? The Prestige? or The Science?
Tesla's magic box?
How was that possible to create a duplicate copy of everything! It might be better not to ask this question for such a movie!
However as a movie it entertained & coufused me at best!
Love it and of course I'll watch it again.

This movie is one the best movie i have ever seen. Prestige is one of the movie you should see before you die. You might think it is boring but no it is not and the best part is the last part and believe me it is one of the best movies ever

The structure of this story is amazing pulled off by Christopher Nolan .The story of an extreme rivalry between two magicians is great and carried by some great and really underrated performances by Christian bale and hugh Jackman. A must see and a personal favorite

Stumbled across this masterpiece, and so glad I did. Fantastic cast that includes Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine, Scarlett Johanson, and a great cameo from the now departed David Bowie (he actually does a sterling performance for once).
The acting is fab, the directing is brilliant and the storyline with its twists and turns, and one of the best endings will leave you amazed that you'll want to watch it again and again. Don't be put off by the fact that it's about 2 magicians. Its much much more than this.

The best movie I have seen in my life. Movie that inspired me and I cannot imagine my life without it

Usually when I watch something that is longer than two hours I always feel like the timing is too much even if I liked the movie. But here I didn't even feel how the hours passed! This amazing cinematography, brilliant acting and original story captured my mind for two hours straight and then left me with an open mouth at the end. I swear, this movie deserves even a higher rate. It's marvelously good. Struggle for victory, obsession of the lead characters to be the best and let's not forget, there's twist and excitement all over the place, The Prestige has everything to be a masterpiece. And it is. I'm doing you a favor by saying you should watch it! You don't wanna miss this.9.5/10

First of all I am kinda bias because I am a magician, but it is also because it shows the struggles magicians go through. Keep in mind they are overdoing the struggles, but having to do what they did are real things that happen sometimes as a magician. I really enjoyed it and anybody who likes magic should really watch it just do not try any of the tricks.

The prestige is just so unpredictable that you wort see the final scene in the film coming. Great acting script and setting. It takes you to an otter World, its movie making ad its Best. Its sure Worth a watch.

The story, the cast, the overall atmosphere, twists, all smooth, elegant and with style... and the awesome finale. Rarely good movie.8,5/10

An interesting and well acted mystery drama. Great story and characters, plenty of twists and highly enjoyable. The Victorian London setting is excellent.

This all star cast is just amazing!! Could never get tired of watching this movie. Terrific

Very few movies are worth seeing again and again.
This movie is dope.
The first time I saw this film i didn't quite understand it.
And once you understand it, it becomes a chilling story.
Because it is believable.
Worth it.

Incredible film, really loved it. The costumes and set are beautiful and bring you right into the world, enveloping you in the magic right away. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale carry you through the tension with great finesse. Loved it.

This movie was most certainly worth the time, though might not be for everyone. It did take it's time and it wasn't action packed despite all the magic that it involved. But as a twisted plot you won't see coming, yes, it will grab you there. Performances by all were fantastic. Cinematography incredible and on point. Story line, brilliant.

Sometimes I think cinema is the best way to hide and show concept. This film has this power. And most of all: you can find this ability even in the first frame you see. Is well direct and building a really good movie. Deep on the personal character journey of Bale and Jackman, you can find a lot of humanity. Scene are fantastic, on the classic construction quality from the best industry, keep the viewer in a world, where the unbelievable is possible.

Rewatching this makes it pretty clear what Nolan's primary focus is in storytelling (if it wasn't obvious before) - perspective and the subjective nature of it. What better way to expound on that than in a story about dueling magicians hiding their secrets from one another.There are metaphors galore in this (how could there not be in a film about subjectivity and obsession) but it struck me this time how convenient the story is. It moves constantly and forcefully forward, revealing twists all the way, daring you to try and outguess it, so at first it's easy to miss on the plot contrivances and somewhat simple nature of it all. But I'm also not sure how much that matters. The film works, it really does, even when it's less than artful.

This is a Christopher Nolan film, that's the first thing to notice here. But it's no Dark Knight or an Inception. It's a Magic movie. And... The film will play a bunch off tricks with your mind and way faster than you can say: "Abracadebra!!"Rival magicians Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Borden (Christian Bale) have a long history of bad blood, beginning when Angier blamed Borden for the accidental death of his wife during a show. They part ways and Borden, with his illusion designer Fallon, creates a magic trick called "The Transported Man," in which he enters one cabinet and exits another immediately after. With the help of Nikola Tesla (David Bowie), Angier creates his own version of the trick with a mysterious machine.The story culminates with Borden finding a tank where Angier is drowning and being accused of Angier's murder. There are actually has two twists, one that is mundane and the other which is extraordinary, both based on the reveal of how the two men performed their separate tricks.On stage left, you have Christian Bale's ambitious magician, who reveals that he has pulled off all of his tricks over the years by actually being a pair of twins who have spent their lives acting as a single person. On stage right you have Hugh Jackman's self- destructive showman, who actually helps create a science fiction cloning device that allows him to pull off his illusions. It's two insane plot twists for the price of one, and you didn't see either coming.Angier's machine was actually a cloning device, and his clones were killed after each performance, drowned in a water tank. Borden's twist is simpler but more surprising: Like — he was actually identical twins, the two men each living half as Borden and half as the mysterious Fallon.A must see for everyone not just Nolan fans.

After the success of Batman Begins, Christopher Nolan took on magicians for his fourth original film. Two magicians, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) compete for the greatest illusion. The stage manager Cutter (Michael Caine) accuses Alfred of attempting to steal Angier's trick but murdering him instead and sends him to jail in the furthest forward storyline. The film operates on multiple story lines, one that follows Robert searching for the great inventor Tesla (David Bowie) and his assistant Alley (Andy Serkis) in Colorado, and another storyline that tells the history of Angier and Borden as young magicians. These stories come from diaries that the men read of each other. Alfred meets Sarah (Rebecca Hall) at a magic show and falls for her quickly. In the past, Borden tries a special knot that ends up killing Julia (Piper Perabo), Angier's lover. As Borden starts a solo career, Angier confronts him during a bullet catch trick and shoots his finger off. Having had his revenge, Angier reignites his career with a new name as the Great Danton and a new assistant Olivia Wenscombe (Scarlett Johansson). With the help of Cutter, he performs new tricks with special gadgets but Borden shows up to bust the birdcage and injure a participant. Desperate for a new trick and out of a show, Angier meets with Alley and finally is allowed to meet with Tesla in his hideout. This story parallels the real rivalry between Tesla and Edison over the conducting of electricity. Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com

This film tells the story of two rival magicians, Robert Angier and Alfred Borden, in late Victorian London. After a brief introduction we see Angier drown as a trick appears to have been sabotaged by Borden and the latter in put on trial for his murder but are things what they seem? The story then unfolds from the time they were friends to the final revelation concerning what really happened in that opening scene.Angier and Borden's friendship is irrevocably broken when Angier's wife is killed when a trick goes wrong; Angier is convinced that it was Borden's fault. The two go their own ways and put on rival magic shows. Angier sees a chance for revenge when Borden attempts the famous 'bullet catch' trick; he hides himself amongst the crowd then volunteers to be the man who pulls the trigger, slips a real bullet into the gun and pulls the trigger; Borden survives but loses two fingers. Time passes and Borden develops a new trick; 'The Transporting Man'. This seemingly impossible trick sees Borden enter one cupboard then emerge from another almost instantly. Angier is desperate to replicate the trick but can't figure out how it is done. His ingénieur (trick creator), Cutter, is certain that it must involve a double but Angier is certain that the only man on stage is Borden. He performs his own version, using a double but is unsatisfied; determined to learn the truth he sends his stage assistant, Olivia Wenscombe, to pretend to work for Borden to learn the secret; she steals his notebook but it is encrypted. Angier forces Borden to tell him the key word (Tesla) and this leads him to search out scientist Nikola Tesla in Colorado to get the equipment he needs this ultimately works but not in a way anybody would expect.Anybody familiar with the films of director Christopher Nolan will know to expect the unexpected and shouldn't be put off by the non-linear narrative it isn't just that the story is told in flashback; instead it moves back and forward revealing aspects of the story. This isn't just a gimmick as it works to make things interesting. The way the two magicians' rivalry escalates perfectly encapsulates their obsessions; not just to be the best but also to destroy the other. The cast does a fine job; most notably Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale and Michael Caine who play Angier, Borden and Cutter respectively. They are ably supported by Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson as Borden's wife Sarah and Olivia Wenscombe, there is also an enjoyable cameo from the late David Bowie as Nikola Tesla. The final resolution is rather surprising; largely because it is blatant science-fiction rather than a magic trick this might disappoint some viewers although others will enjoy the dark twist when they realise the secret behind Angier's version of 'The Transporting Man'. Overall I'd certainly recommend this impressive and intriguing film.

In the filmmakers' minds. Instead, it became one of the finest films of the year 2006. "The Prestige" is a perfect example of what a movie should be like if it does not rely on you liking and cheering for the central characters. Neither Angier (Jackman), nor Borden (Bale) are likable characters at all. And yet you are completely under their spell as this film goes on. This may be a bit of a subjective take as I quite like Hugh Jackman and find Bale a joy to watch most of the time as well. And Johansson and Hall are among my favorite actresses as well. But it's not only the cast that makes it so much worth watching. It's also the visual side. Art direction, set decoration, cinematography and costumes are top-notch and even the rare special effects are pretty nice. The film managed two Academy Award nominations for its visual side, both of them very deserved and I actually would not have minded if it had won one of these over "Pan's Labyrinth".The film's director is Christopher Nolan and he also wrote the movie together with his brother after the first Batman film. He also cast some of the actors from his superhero trilogy, including Bale and Caine, the only one who didn't do that much for me. Now back to Nolan's script: I think this is probably the heart and soul of the film. Such love to detail, so much suspense, so many surprises and all these great scenes like the doppelgänger parts or the suicide of Hall's character in the room with all the birds, which were actually the way how he met her when he talked to her nephew. Very very smart screenplay. All in all, the best thing about it, however, is how he wrote the two protagonists and their egos constantly clashing with each other, maybe because they weren't so different after all. Of course, Jackman and Bale give great performances too and that is why it worked so well, but still you cannot appreciate Nolan's effort enough. And his brother's. Lets not forget about him. People say, Nolan has problems when it comes to directing and writing realistic female characters, but I disagree. He managed in this film without a doubt and he also managed in others. When the two magicians fight each other or I should probably say get their hands dirty, literally everybody else in this film is constantly affected: their women, their assistants, their set creators...The accidental death of one character's wife sets off a deadly spiral which results in murder in the end. Or does it really? Nothing in this film is what it seems and we do not only get one major plot twist in the end, but two. Apart from that, the progress in terms of inventions and electricity also brings a completely new dimension of progress for the profession of a magician, actually for life in general, for everybody. So, we also get some interesting references on Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison. I also liked how Nolan revealed some tricks, but not all of them, so the movie itself stays a bit of a mystery still. This was the second time I watched this film and it was as good as the first. I highly recommend watching the almost 10-year-old, 120 minute-long "The Prestige". It's possibly my favorite Christopher Nolan movie.

Additionally to the great cast this movie is very exciting and shows many turns and twists. Christopher Nolan proved once more why he is one of the most wanted director of this time. I am not a fan of magic but this movie is less about magic then about showing how rivalry and the obsession to better than the other can destroy the people. The movie starts off exciting right away and it continues to hold the viewers attention. There is so many twist and changes through the entire movie and nevertheless the viewer never gets confused. This is definitely a movie that is fun to watch and that is definitely worth getting. Also with again world class performances of Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale. This is the perfect movie for having a quiet evening and still wanting to watch an exciting and agitating movie.

Without any doubt this movie comes in top 10 best movies I have ever watched in my lifetime till date and It will surely be for a coming long time. Nothing of this tale left you unsatisfied or bored at a single second. Truly a masterpiece to must have in one's video library. hats off to all the team! Human emotions represented at most vibrant colors and zest of passion of one's mad obsession. Another aspect which drives this movie more near to my heart is the Scientific historical facts used as baseline of story. Magic is not just a game but a way of life. I have watched it numerous times and still it keeps its freshness alive every time I repeat it. Christian bale has surely discovered his best acting career through this movie. Each and every character of this movie is just awesome!

Sorry for the review, but I am not English so there are some mistakes I am sure. :) What I wrote in the summery is true in my opinion. It's sure that this is one of my favorite movie. I think that was the biggest fail of the year that the actors and the director got nothing in the Academy Awards. And I can't imagine which movie was better than this in 2006? Because 2006 was one of the worst year in the film industry in my opinion. I remember just for a few good movie. I recommend the movie for everybody who like to think and not just watching the explosions (which I like, but this movie is about something else). It wasn't long for me, I think this is the kind of movie what I would call "a perfect one". I don't think that everybody could write a better "Prestige" then this. The sound effects and the music created a very good and formidable atmosphere. Oh and my favorite character was Tesla like in science. He was really one of the best scientist who ever lived, maybe better then any one else, but I don't want a debate about this. These are just my opinion. 10/10 More movies like this!!!

The prestige is very glamorous movie.You can not understand it first watching.You must be very clever.So you must be very careful while you was watching the prestige.The movie is telling two young magicians;Robert Angier and Alfred Borden.They want to be well-known.Angier's wife Julia Piper Perabo dead in their show so Angier thinks, responsible is Alfred.Then,they will be enemy lifelong.They will want to bad other one.I think,you should watch this movie with somebody because you can take the other one's idea.If you didn't watch the prestige,you would watch this movie.The movie has a lot of secret . You should find them because if you find them you will be happy .

I have watched it three times. Definitely worth watching for triller-lovers.The conflict between the two(actually, three) magicians has started since Angiers wife was accidentally killed by Borden. The result is foreshadowed in Cutters opening monologue, 'You don't really want to know, You want to be fooled', which is exactly why Angier was reluctant to believe that Borden simply used a double in The Transported Man. Angier and Borden are top magicians with different goals. For Angier, the audience's reaction is considered the most important. And Borden tends to innovate. Both of them are willing to sacrifice. One chooses to kill his clones (or maybe he is killed and replaced by the clone ? the thoughts can probably be cloned as well so the clones know what needs to be done about Borden ) every time he does The Transported Man, while the other sacrifices himself in order to make the tricks perfect. Regarding with the identical twins, Borden(the one got hung) and Fallon(the one killed Angier), I've been desperately trying to figure out which is which during my second viewing. The existence of a twin is also foreshadowed in a few scenes. For instance, when Sarah said she knew something secret about Borden, she must have already found out since she is the one closest to Borden and Fallon. And when Angier asked Fallon about the knot after the accident, he said he wasn't sure, because Borden was the one tied the knot, not him. One more thing, Borden/Fallon was able to see that the other magician pretended to be a cripple to hide the fish tank and Angier couldn't. It indicates that he knew because he has done something similar.A great movie with a great ending. The fact that Fallon appears in front of the daughter reinforces the idea of the third step of a magic trick, which is bringing back the ordinary. A thought-provoking movie as well. To what extent is sacrifice worthy in order to make everything perfect? Is what we see what is really happening, or is it what we want to see?

the prestige is not only a movie as it is a masterpiece. apart from the acting, which extraordinary and amazing to watch, the plot and the way the story was built are the things which really stand out. firstly, it is not a movie for everyone as it requires some concentration and thinking. the plot is sophisticated in just a different way that is built by such a perfect manner, you wont see anything like it. the ending will leave you breathless and the final sentence will show you that this movie is the best. the only problem i face is that after watching this movie i could not see other movies as nothing can compare to this mesmerizing masterpiece/

Oh man, this one had me right up to the part with the transporter/duplicator machine. Until then it was a compelling and complex tale dealing in murder, mystery and intrigue with a clever backdrop of magicians attempting to outdo each other with the grandest illusion of all time. What I'm not going to do is go back and watch this three times in a row like I did with "Memento" because when all is said and done, I won't be any better off. In a way I felt cheated that an 1880's era film would bring in a fictional sci-fi element the way it did. It seems to me the story could have gotten around that contrivance to come up with a more realistic resolution that confined itself to existing science and techniques of illusion. Then, when Borden (Christian Bale) had his final showdown with Angier (Hugh Jackman), he could have caught the bullet to end the picture on a more promising note. I don't really mean to sound so harsh on the film because like I said, up to the Tesla part this story was going great guns. Maybe because the guy portraying Tesla looked so much like David Bowie, it kept me off stride for a while as well. Then it turned out to be Bowie when the credits rolled, and I was back to thinking about that business with the cats and the hats. Maybe the whole thing was an illusion.

Back in town, Chris Nolan gave the world one of his best masterpieces. He's without any doubt one of the best directors of the current times. There ain't who does better breathtaking mysteries and sharp thrillers that just delight who ever enjoys mind breaking stories. With The Prestige, Nolan explores the fruitful world of magics. The story's about two magicians, somewhere around 1900. Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale). At first they were helping a magician performing his acts. The major act consisted in tying Angier's wife's hands (Julia (Piper Perabo)) and drop her in a cage filled with water. A huge cloth would came down covering it and when it was pushed back up Julia should have already untied the knot and escaped from the cage. Before a show, Angier, Borden and the engineer of illusions, Cutter (Michael Caine) argued about which knot should be used, as Borden defended that another knot to replace the one being used, but both Angier and Cutter refused. In that exact show, Julia drowns inside the cage. Angier immediately blames Borden. Angier and Borden take different paths, Angier hires Cutter as his engineer and Borden Bernard Fallon as his. Angier also hires Olivia Wenscombe (Scarlett Johansson) to help him on stage. Meanwhile, Borden meets and marries Sarah (Rebecca Hall). Performing a trick that Borden called The Bullet Catch, Angier shows up in a Borded's show offering himself to volunteer and tricks Borden, injuring him severely on two fingers. Progressively, competitiveness grows between both. The plot develops with this competition, as each one of them creates the most elaborate and schemer acts of London and try to uncover the partner's in order to beat him. It's amazing how Nolan concentrates the mystery of the tricks until the very last moments, focusing all the answers in the end. If the viewer focuses on certain details he might find possible to unveil the actual solution but my own experience tells me that is not very likely to happen. Hugh Jack is good, better that he accustomed us, but Chritian Bale ruled. I'm not his biggest fan but the truth is there ain't a lot of actors doing better than him nowadays. The truth is that this movie actually has some historical accuracy. For example, Nikola Tesla did in fact experiment in Colorado Springs, building including the Magnifying Transmitter, shown in the movie. But I didn't like some aspects of the tricks, mostly about using impossible magic in this movie. It really works against the movie. In spite of that, this mystery thriller is one of the best I've seen. And yes it's true. You want to see it again the second it's over. 10/10

I saw this movie here in Brazil on cable TV, then I went to my DVD store, bought a copy and started to watch it again and again at home. This is simplely one of the finest movies that I saw in my whole life.Everything in the movie is perfect: Production, cast, soundtrack, etc, etc. But, besides that, the script is doing a lot more than to tell you the story of the magicians who are competing to be the "best". Actually, it seems to be inviting you, by metaphorical ways, to think and analyze the process of ideological construction and interpretation of our day-to-day reality. At the beginning and at the end, Michael Caine's character says "you are not really looking, you want to be fooled". Is he talking only about theather magic or algo talking about how we construct our vision of the world and our opinions about the most varied subjects? As a fellow user of this site said, there many layers in this movie to be analysed and discussed, and it is still a commercial movie, not some kind of experimental video done by college students. That, by itself, is an awesome achievement.The movie says that we want to be fooled, and that the magicians, in order to fool their audience, must be willing to deal with brutality and secrets. Aren't the magicians, in this movie, a representation of our parents, leaders, bosses, and those who have power and need to ideologically and morally justify themselves, in order to stay in power? The upper classes need to present their rule as just and natural, but they know that power can not be achieved and retained only by virtous manners. As Nicolai de Machiavelly pointed out centuries ago, you have to get your hands dirty in order to be a prince/a magician/to mistify, confuse, engage your audience/subjects and achieve your goals/perform your magic trick successfully.And the audience is us, the ordinary people who live their daily, working class lifes, willing to believe our bosses so we can sleep tonight. We want to be fooled.

This movie seems to get better every time I watch it, each little detail fits together so perfectly. It's impossible to fault, Nolan is a true genius. By far my favourite movie of all time,. Definitely deserves more than a sloppy 8.4 rating for such a magical piece, unfortunately it doesn't seem to take hold of everyone as strongly as it did me.Firstly the genre of the movie fitted perfectly to my liking, the movie was coated with a dark atmosphere, & the twist revolving around Borden was by far the best I've ever seen in a movie, i found the measures he took for what he loves doing to be inspiringIf i had to pick one imperfection from the movie, It would be the machine made by Tesla, although i felt it added a special touch to the movie, I can see how some people would say it was just an easy way to end it.

This movie is not for everybody; it is an exquisite mix of flashbacks and developments, more complex than Memento, but some viewers will find it confusing, complicated, or will see plot holes over the first half of the movie. The jumps in the time line are not an obstacle to character development, but help them as back stories; I got acquainted to the characters in The Prestige and actually cared about their struggles, their successes, and the deaths. Acting was very good overall, the environment was good and I felt in the 19th century. This is a recommended movie for intelligent people, ready to accept the twists and the moments of confusion in the midst of the story.

The Prestige begins like a camera completely out of focus. Nothing makes any sense. Nolan's film flips backwards and forwards through time like he's having a Memento flashback, characters wander across the screen talking about things we can't begin to understand. Locations appear, performances are had, and for a moment I thought I'd misread something and it was actually directed by David Lynch. Not so. Before long things start getting clearer. Bit by bit, everything comes into focus, a gradual process until by its end the film's brilliant, complete picture is crystal clear. To get there, you'll have to earn it. You'll have to hate it before you like it. During it's running time The Prestige will make you irritated, confused, exasperated, frustrated but before it's over... you'll fall in love with it. It's not just Nolan's best film; it's one of the best of the year. Unlike the lame-duck Illusionist, The Prestige is actually about magicians. The film ducks in and out of the lives of two rival performers, as they build their careers and trample over one another on their way to success in late 19th century London. Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) start out together, working for a rival magician. Both aspire to a career in magic, but Angier refuses to get his hands dirty while Borden proclaims the only way to become a great magician is a path of total commitment. Things go wrong, they part as enemies. Angier holds a grudge against Borden and they go out in the world to make their fortune. Meanwhile Borden has an ace up his sleeve: an unbeatable trick. He walks in one door and out another across the room and calls it "The Transported Man". Unable to fathom how he's done it, the trick drives Angier completely mad. Their rivalry grows more vicious and desperate, with their magic skills used not only to wow audiences but wreak havoc on one another. None of it's really that simple. Telling you anything more though would be criminal. The movie unfolds as it should, with Chris and Jonathan Nolan's script teasing you along with glimpses of the future. Nothing is certain in this incredibly complex tale of rivalry, revenge, and misdirection. The film wraps itself in the world of magic, employing tricks of its own to lead the audience towards an incredibly conclusion. The cast is beyond compare. Jackman and Bale are supremely gripping as Angier and Borden, and my ass spent most of the movie on the edge of my seat simply waiting for the moments when they'd finally confront one another. Michael Caine is back as another crotchety mentor, but there's a reason for that. He's damned good at it. David Bowie shows up playing completely against type as Dr. Nikola Tesla assisted by the better than ever Andy Serkis. Scarlett Johansson and Piper Perabo play more minor roles in the film. They're assistants, so their job is to look incredibly hot. They're great at that. The movie's so packed with twists and turns that for some following it will prove impossible. What I'm saying here is that like Nolan's first noteworthy film Memento, The Prestige isn't interested in pandering. This is incredibly high level storytelling, in fact there's a good chance it'll go right over some people's heads. This is Memento era Nolan back from the grave. This isn't the director of big Hollywood films like Batman Begins and Insomnia. This is the guy who made a movie from the perspective of a man with a five second memory, and then managed to make it better by showing the damn thing upside down and in reverse. This time he's taken his gift for the tangled and dense, and topped himself. It's completely absorbing. Don't blame the movie if it flies over audiences heads, what Nolan's done here is a masterpiece of entertainment and art.

With all the furore surrounding Inception, this is a good time to rediscover Nolan's earlier (and, it has to be said, much better) movie, The Prestige. The tale of two competing magicians in the 1800's, the film is blessed with great performances throughout and a story so ingenious, so convoluted, so beautifully realised that it will keep you guessing till the final frame and will have you discussing the story for days after first viewing. While it evidently didn't achieve the box office clout of Nolan's bigger films, this is nonetheless a superb piece of cinema and one that I would heartily recommend to anyone who appreciates an ingenious story.Philip Caveney

Chris Nolan does it again, he keeps churning out incredible films one after another. The Prestige is no exception. The first line of the film is by far the most important line, "Are you watching closely?". The first time I saw this movie, I thought it was only a good movie, maybe a 7/10... but after seeing it a few more times, I was amazed at what I had missed. Christian Bale had another outstanding performance alongside Michael Caine and Nolan (They're quite the team). And Hugh Jackman delivers what could be his best performance yet. Even David Bowie was quite good! I highly recommend this film to anyone and everyone, but make sure you watch it closely!!!

as i said this film is truly awesome, a piece of modern film 'magic' again by chris nolan. i wont go into all the twists and turns and change in eras as other comments have, but will just say the film leaves you feeling more entertained than many blockbuster films that rely on cgi have ever done, and also duped by all the subtle hints that are dropped throughout the film that we don't notice. I have just finished watching the movie for what must be 10-15th time, and still find these bits funny when i see them as some are so obvious,but at the same time woven into the story beautifully, and i am still also finding parts that open up more discussion!! One of the greatest films ever crafted, just as good as batman begins and the dark knight!!

For some reason I decided not to see this in the cinema and now I am really annoyed that I didn't. This is a brilliant film. Beautifully paced, complex and dark.One of the reasons that I didn't go see it in the cinema is that I'm not a big fan of magic or steam punk but what this film is really about is the art and mind of the illusionist.The twist in the story keeps itself hidden right to the end. The storyline despite being complex is wonderfully coherent as well. There are no unnecessary scenes in the whole film. It's very reminiscent of Fight Club in some ways.I'd highly recommend this film to everyone.

Intriguing, wondrous exploration of illusions and science/magic, with much to leave the viewer thinking for quite a while after the end. Beautifully done--writing, acting, directing, design--all transport us to a fictional previous time and place.Very philosophical, yet enjoyable for those who just want to experience a good story.I only wish I'd seen this in a theater instead of on DVD. If it is ever re-released, be sure to see it on the big screen. I will. This is one film that almost requires repeat viewings to fully appreciate the nuances.

The prestige is about two rivaling magicians in London during the turn of the century. Nolan accomplished a unique, not to say magical movie. From the actors and their performances to the dialogs to the background music...everything is presented in a magical way. Every great movie consists of three acts. The first act is called The Pledge: The movie shows you something ordinary, but of course it isn't. The second act is called The Turn: The movie makes his ordinary something do something extraordinary. Now, if you're looking for the secret you won't find it. That's why there's a third act, called The Prestige. This is the part with the twists and turns, where lives hang in balance, and you see something shocking you've never seen before. You have just seen The Prestige! :)

The 2000's has not been a great movie decade. This movie will be one of the 10 best unless 09 really shines. Not a dull moment, not a line ignored, strong performances from a great cast, and in the final moment, you realize you were missing the obvious for the whole movie. The music set the mood for every light and dark moment, the lighting was superb, as mentioned on the disk, a lot of earth colors that make the moments seem calm, but still surrealistic.And finally the photography, made the magic seem even more real. You will not find many movies of this decade that were better, come to think of it, you will not find a lot of movies ever that will top this excellent film.

"Prestige" is pure entertainment, what can i say? it's just amazing! i loved every second of it, and I've recommended it to my family and friends, and i didn't shut up until everyone i knew had seen it.everyone liked it. why? this movie is visually amazing, the natural light is very well managed, and the movie has a "not hard to look at" Gothic thing going on.the movie is all about story, story, story. twists, twists, twists. But attention, there are smart twist! and this is very unusual, because American movies rarely have good twists, and this movie has a lot of good ones.In the end, is pure entertainment, but it's something new: Smart Entertainment. Everyone will love it. It's simply genius, simply delicious.

After taking a long break from magic related movies in Hollywood; cinema-goers were struck by this movie and the respect it so-obviously demanded. Throughout the movie one cant help but to be attracted to its underlined sense of mystery and the urge to unfold the secret of the magic tool to which we are introduced, in the beginning of the film. With astonishing performances by both Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, i would would gladly gives two thumbs up to this motion picture. However, some may claim that the strong resemblance to the movie 'The Illusionist' may have stolen some its charm, seeing as both movies were released at around the same time.

This is probably one of the best movies I have ever watched with a great cast, awesome plot, and spectacular production set. Both Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are superb in their respective roles as rival magicians in Victorian-era London. I actually had to watch it twice on certain mysterious scenes in order to get the surprise ending. The best part is that there is a sub-plot regarding Nikolos Telsa, the "Father of Electromagnetism and electrical AC current", and Thomas Edison on who is the best inventor in the field of electromagnetism. The sub-plot will give the basis on the competition between Jackman and Bale's characters in this movie. I would look for various clues throughout the movie in order to understand the finale.

This has got to be one of the most amazing films i have ever seen.truly...fantastic..exuberant...best place to be ever.It was recommended to me by friends but i never listened until one lonely night in which i said to myself..i have to go see it..and i did: the result is i was dazed..and still am..a great story acted almost without flaws..accents and lust.Kane was just outstanding...his way of narrating the story kept me so close to it that i was living it by the end.I am the spectator that wants to see behind the stage..that will search for answers...Go see it if u haven't so far ! Fantastic !

Hugh Jackman Is on fire!!!! Every movie he touches is great. A spectacular actor. Chris Nolan (the director) is also on fire. All his movies seem to be fantastic. This is not really a period piece even though it is set in Victorian England, but told not through the repressive usual way, but from the way that Victorian England was also a time of great amazement, People all over sought amazement as this time was the height of science and therefore pseudo-science. This movie has the best storyline ever. the Storyline is itself a magic trick and you won't know how it comes together till the end and when you do, it's a bit scary. A great movie totally under the radar of great blockbusters but I wouldn't have it any other way.

This movie is my favorite movie of all time. I saw it in theaters with my friends and was crying hysterically at the end. one of the last lines is really a killer. You have to see it at least twice to get EVERYTHING, because it is pretty fast paced compared to other movies with a lot of details. The ending will have you shocked, astonished, and willing to watch it again and again. I'm very very glad that this movie made IMDb's top 250 movie list because it deserves to be up there. Even though it didn't win any Oscars or golden globes, I know that they did a phenomenal job on it. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are fantastic actors to begin with, and this was the first movie I've seen with Scarlett Johansson in it. If you haven't seen it, go rent it NOW!

I had heard great things about this film when I rented it. And I have to say that The Prestige was a great movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It had so many twists and turns and kept me guessing until the very end! Christian Bale plays Alfred Borden, a gifted magician who's tricks are so mind-boggling that they seem almost impossible to perform. Hugh Jackman plays Robert Angier, an equally talented magician who is good friends with Borden. But one night during a show one of Angier's tricks goes horribly wrong and his wife Julia, played by Piper Perabo, is killed. And Borden is partially blamed for the accident because he tied the ropes on Julia's hands differently. As a result of the accident Angier and Borden become rivals. They show up at each other's shows and make their tricks malfunction. One night Borden performs a trick so mind-boggling and visual that Angier sets out on a quest to find out how exactly he did it. His search for the answer delves him deeper into the mind of Borden and what really happened to his wife during that fateful trick.The Prestige was also a beautiful movie. The cinematography was excellent and the costumes were stunning. But what really made this movie great was the superb acting. Christian Bale was excellent was Alfred Borden. He spoke with a wonderful English accent. It rolled off his tongue perfectly. He made you love him because he was such a talented magician but he also made you hate him because of the way he treated his wife and the things he done to mess up Angier's tricks. Hugh Jackman is always great in any role he plays. His character Robert Angier was sympathetic and emotional and he made you feel the heartbreak he was going through. You could tell that all he wanted to be was a great magician and that he just wanted his wife back. I loved his character. The always great Michael Caine had a great supporting role as Cutter, Borden and Angier's mentor who taught them how to be the masterminds at magic. Scarlett Johansson was average as Olivia, Angier's assistant who becomes romantically involved with Borden. And Rebecca Hall was great as Sarah, Alfred Borden's neglected wife. Then David Bowie was good as Nicola Tesla, a legend in magic who Angier turned to for advice to be the best magician ever. But I enjoyed all the acting. There wasn't a performance I didn't' like.The Prestige is a wonderful piece of film-making. It was wonderfully directed, written, and acted. Any fans of Christian Bale or Hugh Jackman should watch this. I don't think you'll be disappointed. I'm glad I rented this. I truly loved it. And I loved the twist at the end. I was not expecting that and I was enthralled by it. It was superb. This is a great movie. thanks for reading my review!

I went into this movie and for the first quarter of the movie, it was near my expectation, then the story and where the characters go with their intentions and plans just totally blew me away. Great effects, great acting and a wonderful story that is about magic but also about the magic of science in the early years of the industrial revolution.I don't want to provide any spoilers so I will say, this movie may come off as weird to some and genius to others, but all in all it was well told, well executed and the production is very good. Some of the ideas, notions and magic of science in this film. Top notch acting, great mixture of characters. You will like this movie if you liked movies similar to Requiem for a Dream, The Illusionist, Donnie Darko, The Fountain, and film in the like.

I have never, ever seen a movie this good in my entire life! The acting is fantastic, the story is 100% original, and the end blows you away! When I first saw the trailer for the movie I knew instantly it was going to be a good one. How many movies are there of magicians and stuff like that? I really enjoyed this film. This is the best movie I have seen Christian Bale in, and he really did an amazing job! Scarlett Johannson and Hugh Jackman did a fabulous job also. The chemistry between the actors and characters was unbelievable! It kept the suspense going through the entire film making me think "oh my god, what's going to happen? what is he going to do?" and I love that in a movie! The ending, of course, was so cool! This is definitely "movie making at its *very* best!" If you haven't seen it yet, then watch it! You'll be astonished at how amazing this movie is! I don't understand why it didn't win every single Acadamy Award...Well, then again, critics don't know how to critique the right way so...oh well. Just watch the movie, OK? You'll love it! Guaranteed.

..this movie rocks big time!! since i saw its trailer, i've been wanting to see it in the movie house..i quite expected a boring movie though (i mean, some movie stories are interesting but the scenes just drag throughout)..but The Prestige really surprised me! not one part was boring! it kept me (and my friends) thinking...really nice plot...i commend the writer and the director..this movie however is not a movie for everyone. but to those who want to watch a movie they can scratch their heads over (and rave over the plot), well, you better grab a DVD copy now! "nice kaayo!"..it won't disappoint you...you should WATCH CLOSELY...

bird in the cage..it wasn't sweet.. i have to confess that i have been purchasing duplicated DVD movies for weeks..i don't have so many discs that within an archive..i think this movie deserves a golden crown..i will have the DVD whatever it costs. hey men Scarlett is just a trick ,oke? and finally i want men to do something before watching the movie..read about Nikola Tesla..tips about fiction..Rivalry between two men takes you to the top of the obsession..in social life fighting for girls,for money are usual..but this is distinct..a huge blade which two men walking on two sharp edges..and i celebrate the director because he left the decision whether if Angier is right or not..

As we used to wit Nolan's.. Very high and sophisticated peace of art.. Memento was not forgettable.. but this one is..miracle ! Best direction,screenplay,DOP,editing and acting for sure.. Hugh Jackman exceeded him self in The Fountain and Kate & Leopold Either Christian Bale get over restriction metal Forms in his previous Equilibrium & Batman Begins "with Nolan too!!" Great work men and women .. Scarlett : you have a great career to achieve David Bowie..fabulous manly new-look At the end I'd like to raise my virtual hat to the Lord of the actors : Michael CaineHasan Amin Egypt

I would like to know what the song is called when the credits role? The song at the very end is quite good i would like to know the title of the ending song. It is played right after Micheal Ciane says all of the acts and after you see the final image the credits begin to role and the song begins, i just want to know the title of that song its very catchy, it has a cool beat to it and the vocals are good too. the movie overall was amazing i never thought the twists would end there were so many times where i thought that it was the final conclusion but there was always something much more exciting that would be later revealed. I really started to follow Christian bale's character up until Huge jackmans new trick which i didn't see coming at all, the ending however was really good i really enjoyed this movie.

The competition between Bale and Jackman is mesmerizing. They each have a separate way of drawing you in and making you sympathize with their own struggle. Jackman is a man completely obsessed with finding the secret to Bale's mysterious abilities. Bale, it seems, is only half a man at any given time, sometimes completely engulfed in his magic and illusions, other times he is a warm loving husband and father who just happens to be a magician. Every time Jackman and Bale are on the screen together you can feel yourself pulling to the edge of your seat waiting to see whats next in their quarrel for greatness. Deep and dark secrets lie in both men, but you cant help but wonder who has taken it too far. With more than a few unexpected plot twists, and laden with hidden clues throughout the movie as to the truth behind both men, The Prestige is a movie you need to watch at least twice. While you watch it ask yourself, as Bale says many times throughout the film, are you watching closely?

Like great stage magic, THE PRESTIGE is a work of craft not commerce, and as such it is a daring and delicate piece of art. The Nolan brothers have adapted Christopher Priest's dense novel into a bold, powerful film which, like even the simplest of magic tricks, could fail miserably were one false move made in its execution. Yet as the director of a complex psychological tapestry such as MEMENTO or the character-driven revival of a pop culture knight in BATMAN BEGINS, Christopher Nolan electrifies THE PRESTIGE with the dark mysteries of the human soul which propel these two magicians into chaotic conflict, never once bungling his three-act wonder.As for the screenplay, once again the Nolan brothers base their films on a sturdy foundation of a script, which exploits the subject's inherent bias toward illusion without ever devolving into a gimmick-cluttered plot. Though there are plenty of suspenseful twists and turns as these characters pursue ever-darker paths of professional achievement and personal destruction. The script invites its audience to look behind the curtains of stage magic without ever fully surrendering the artistry behind it. THE PRESTIGE is the difference between knowing the trick and knowing how to perform it, perfectly demonstrating our fascination with revealing a mystery and still being captured by it. As layer upon layer of illusion, lies and half-truths are peeled back, our journey to the heart of this intense rivalry of magicians becomes more obscured by how these men manipulate reality to confound our suspicions and expectations. The end result is sheer, enthralling entertainment.THE PRESTIGE is the third stage of a magic trick, "the part with the twists and turns, where lives hang in the balance, and you see something shocking you've never seen before." And so THE PRESTIGE delivers on that promise, as Christopher Nolan adds another masterwork to his rich history of film successes that promise only to grow better and more consistently enjoyable with each project. His latest work, is no parlor trick at all  THE PRESTIGE is true cinema magic.

I really liked this movie, specially the metaphors and plays about the different identities of the characters and the astonishing tricks. I was so amazed that i decided to spend all my life trying to obtain the "Transported Man" trick. I've given a first try, check it out!Copy and paste: http://one.revver.com/watch/157915Just to be honest, i've to say that many of the techniques and the ideas shown in this movie had been already used by the director Christopher Nolan in "Memento", which is with no doubt (imho, obviously) his real masterpiece: flashbacks, enigmas, ambiguity of the characters, etc. Perhaps "Memento" is a little excessive; in order to fully understand the movie you must watch it almost twice (with high level of attention). "The Prestige" is a more commercial version of Memento, but it includes all the features and the ideas that made fantastic Memento.

As has already been mentioned enough, the cast and acting are first rate, so I'll shift my focus on the meta level of this terrific plot. But forgive me as I have to mention that seeing David Bowie as Tesla was just brilliant! Well I saw the movie the second time tonight and it just hit me, how perfect all the edges and twists come out in the end and perfectly make sense. It is simply brilliant, how the two opponents are not just simply opponents, but as the story unfolds not only do they become the total oppositions of each other, but also turn out to be the almost complete antipode to the characters they started of with, themselves. One had everything and was already complete, but has indefinitely lost it. So now he has to become more to do the trick and be able to live on. The other is the cause for his loss over and over again and also seems to be getting what he has lost. But has to suffer from having to live as an entity of two men, all the time, only to finally become one in the end. After he himself has almost lost everything. The showing and telling of the simple bird-trick at the beginning and ending of the movie exemplifies this. And we see and hear it in a completely different way then, than we did in the beginning. Because now we simply know. One has to make huge sacrifices, the sacrifice of life, either way! If the world sees/knows or not. It shows on many levels, how obsessions can make us lose everything we have and ever wanted, even if or especially if we can have it all and take it for granted. Over revenge, rivalry and simply over being the greatest magician, ... In the end what does it offer us, staying true to ourselves, our love for our family and friends and as in every relation, the herein literally vital need to communicate everything.

On surface level, the film is a gorgeous treat. It is beautifully designed and crafted, with lush and never too eye-popping cinematography while still remaining quietly beautiful. All the set and costume design perfectly emulates the Victorian time period without ever seeming like it's trying to hard. On the contrary  as a historic presentation, it is a very fascinating portrayal of a form of entertainment that reached indescribable peaks of popularity during this particular time period. From a technical standpoint, the film is a sleek and stylish success.It also uses an interesting storytelling technique of a mixed-up chronology in order to further add to the initial confusion, although everything comes together in the end. It's not quite on par with the mixed chronology of 21 Grams, but it's an interesting sort of "return to form" for director Christopher Nolan after Memento.The acting is also fantastic from everyone involved, although nobody stands out in particular. Bale and Jackman lead the pack and both provide excellent turns, while the supporting players Caine, Johansson, Bowie and even Andy Serkis' small but memorably supporting role all provide satisfying performances with much expertise.But it is when we get to the story itself that the film somewhat trips over itself. Fact of the matter is, the twist (or rather, twists) at the end of the film were, at least as I found, painfully predictable. Let's not mention the Angier twist which became apparent the moment the surprise success of Tesla's machine is revealed: But even the Borden twist, which was slightly more surprising if you ask me, was easily foreseen  the way Nolan presented the character of Borden's mentor/secret keeper came across as extremely suspicious from frame one, and it soon became apparent that the solution to Borden's trick lay within this character. On the other hand, one element of the story that could have gone wrong but instead throws the movie in its most interesting direction is the somewhat science fiction/fantasy element of Tesla's machine  more on this later. I found the end in which everything is revealed to be more under whelming than what Nolan may have been aiming for, but luckily, Nolan doesn't fail to deliver.Had the film been left in the hands of another filmmaker, the twists at the end may have been portrayed as the point of the film. And the repetition of Cutter's opening lines may throw the audience off guard and in the direction of the twist being of the most importance. But it is not so. The true meaning of the film lies in the line "No one cares about the man in the box." Allow me to explain.While slightly failing in the storytelling department, as a tale of morality and the human spirit, the film is incredibly successful and amazingly poignant. It seems that Nolan's auteur as a director is beginning to take form, as very specific themes can be found in all of his features. First and foremost, all of his features deal with the human mind one way or another. Memento and Insomnia both portray a mental condition. Batman Begins certainly portrays how Bruce Wayne was scarred for life by a traumatic event (the death of his parents) that drives all of his actions in the film. And now The Prestige also portrays a similar scarring, of how a traumatic event can lead to dangerous obsession. Which brings me to a further and more specific theme Nolan has in all of his features: Obsession. In Memento, Leonard is so obsessed with finding his wife's killer, he simply refuses to accept that he has already been found, since obsession is all that drives him through life. In Insomnia, Dormer's character forms a very unhealthy obsession with the murder involving Walter. In Batman Begins, Bruce Wayne's obsession with revenge against his parents' death drives him to extreme measures. And now in The Prestige, we find Angier, who is clearly obsessed with proving his worth against Borden, throwing all moral boundaries out in order to achieve his goal. Imagine the moral implementations of killing yourself again and again and again but always coming back. It's mind-blowing just to think of how obsessed you must be to do such a thing to yourself.Ultimately, while the twists of the film don't necessarily work, it is a lavish and beautifully produced product while managing to both entertain and portray a haunting depiction of human morality, obsession and the human mind's shocking ways of dealing with such things. In this sense, the film is an utter success, and a harrowingly difficult one to process at that.

We are mystified about which kind of knot Borden ties before the accident, and I find it strange, however dramatically efficient, that Nolan doesn't use the question until the burial. I think that in real life that would be the first thing one would check to see what went wrong with a trivial trick - especially because it has been an issue between them. But certainly a highly entertaining movie, with great acting, beautiful pictures, and a catching storyline. Like "The Departed" it is a movie one can watch over and over again and still enjoy for it's many twists and cleverly situated clues. The mind-blowing experiment with electricity which is accredited to Dr Telsa, is symbolically destroyed by Edison. The rivalry of the plot mirrors itself on another level, bringing back the words of Oscar Wilde from the same period: "The world is(...)tolerant, it will forgive anything; except genius."

(DO NOT READ unless you have seen the movie or don't mind having it spoiled!)The Prestige seems to be one of those rare occasions when the movie is better than the book it's based on. The movie works well, and is very well produced. It's not without flaws, but the central stroke of brilliance is to bring in Nikola Tesla and using his outlandish theories to support the story of a couple of rivaling magicians in their attempt to out-do one another. This is a great idea, and the use of it in this movie is VERY cool. To those who don't know, Tesla both theorized about, and performed, several experiments that have never been reproduced, and so it is a great way to partially suspend disbelief to have some of his wild and mysterious ideas actually work.The movie falls short in several minor ways, though. For one thing, neither of the main characters are particularly likable. They come across as just that little bit too pathetic, even if they do sacrifice practically everything for their art (or was it for their rivalry?). I felt it would have been better to have one of them (the lower-class one, Bale's character) be more sympathetic than the other, and even end up duplicating himself to sort of recreate his lost twin. But we didn't see that, and instead Bale's character cowardly just shot Jackman's character out of pure spite. Doesn't exactly reflect well on him, does it.Also - the Tesla machine; in some scenes it teleported Jackman's character, and in others it made copies of him. So, which one was it? Could it be adjusted to do one or the other? Or did it do either at random? This was not explained. And the caged pigeon trick; this was always obscured. What was it supposed to do, exactly? Oh, I can guess (it slammed down flat, seeming to crush the pigeon, which however was speedily pulled out and hidden under the coat), but it couldn't be seen, and this annoyed me as I was watching it. But maybe it was because they couldn't actually do it, and hence not show it.Still, good and entertaining movie. I could definitely watch it again sometime. 8 out of 10.

I LOVED this movie. As if the costumes, scenery, acting etc. weren't wonderful enough, the story was so riveting! It has been quite the springboard for discussions about obsession, ambition, and love with my teenage kids. What price will we pay to capture our dreams? The image of Sarah hanging with the other expendable magic objects (birds) was so chilling.I loved it even more the second time we saw it. There is one item we still can't resolve. Maybe you saw something we didn't. Was the twin of Freddy (AKA Fallon) biological or a Tesla double? Freddy was at the exhibition watching the Tesla demonstration. He used TESLA as his cipher, so he was aware of the man and his machine. My buddy and I can't agree... Or maybe it was a twin brother.

Godard's Dictum: The cinema is truth 24 frames per second." Rejoinder: "The cinema is illusion, is lying 24 frames per second." *The Prestige* is everything *The Illusionist* wanted to be  and claimed to be in its trailers  an unholy tale of a magician seeking arcane Real Magic.Both films are set in 1899 London, but whereas *The Illusionist* is a whiny bitch that tries too hard to please, *The Prestige* is an egomaniac that criss-crosses veins of intrigue and misdirection, pumping you breathless with half-lies and false truths until its powerful climax.In other words, *The Prestige* is the penis to *The Illusionist'*s vagina.Christian Bale (as cockney as he wants to be) is magician Borden, and Hugh Jackman (as suave as X-Man Logan is not) is magician Angier, friends working as audience plants for an elderly magician, whose female assistant is Angier's wife (Piper Perabo, from the Julia Roberts School of big-mouth bass masquerading as beautiful women). In tying an incorrect trick knot one night, Borden accidentally gets Angier's wife killed in a drowning tank, resulting in he and Angier becoming mortal career rivals.Like a Marvel and DC Comics team-up, it's Batman versus Wolverine and, like their alter-egos from other films, Borden (Bale) is the brooding, genius magician whilst Angier (Jackman) is the showman who lives for the quick strike and audience adulation. Borden develops "The Transported Man," a trick of such ingenuity Angier believes Borden has tapped into Real Magic, despite the advice of veteran magician's assistant, Cutter (Michael Caine, here playing a kind of Alfred to Borden's Batman and Angier's Wolverine simultaneously).Scarlett Johansson plays Angier's assistant, Olivia, who flits between both magicians as a double-crossing, counter-spying lover and I cannot discern whether her non-believability is because she is "acting" duplicitous or because she can't act; Much like Vivien Leigh in *A Streetcar Named Desire*, her false style clashes with the other polished principals; either way, chalk it up to another miscast iPod surfer girl amidst acting giants. (I suspect Scarlett continues to work in movies purely on the strength of her heaving mammii.) Cutter's voice-over describes the three stages of a magic act, all quite self-explanatory: The Pledge, The Turn, and The Prestige.The movie itself plays out the three stages, as it Pledges with an opening scene that has us believing Borden has killed Angier in a drowning tank; The Turn takes us deep into Borden's and Angier's notebooks, flashbacks within flashbacks showing us Borden, the financially-struggling magician whose incredible tricks are pearls before the swine of London's working class, whilst Angier thrills the bourgeoisie, making up for half-baked tricks with his showmanship; Borden takes a working class wife (Rebecca Hall) and fathers a child, which stokes Angier's hatred, until - The Prestige, which, as Cutter narrates, "is the part with the twists and turns, where lives hang in the balance, and you see something shocking you've never seen before." If you heeded *The Prestige*'s opening line, "Are you watching closely?" its myriad mysteries would be laid bare as a Catholic priest's homosexual sins. But, like all magicians' audiences, we're here to be misdirected by the magic.Neil Burger's *The Illusionist* (2006) made the mistake of creating illusions which were too complex to be real tricks, but *The Prestige* goes in another direction, calling upon Science to augment the illusions. As Arthur C. Clarke portended: "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." And the scientist enlisted by Angier is none other than "the man who invented the twentieth century"  Nikola Tesla, a real life Hungarian inventor, physicist and electrical engineer (played by David Bowie, in the first real acting of his movie career, burying himself in the brow-furrowed role). (If it were not for Tesla's arcane delving into nuclear physics, magnetism, alternating and direct current - yes, Tesla invented AC/DC before Bon Scott and Angus Young - we would not have those blue "bzzzz" things for Frankenstein movies (Tesla coils) which graduated to those crimson-blue-lightning balls (Plasma globes), also invented by Tesla  and duly misused at drunken frat parties the world over since).At one point, Tesla states, "Exact science is not an exact science." Though this may sound like ammunition for creationists and other lunatics, it is actually true pertaining to Scientific Method, which never lays claim to absolute truths, rather "transitional truths"  as new information comes to the fore, obsolete information must necessarily be updated or discarded. Science is pliable, provable, practical.Still, it is ironic that in invoking the effigy of such a great scientist, the movie takes another Turn and actually breaches the bastion of Real Magic, when Tesla (aided by his Igor, Andy Serkis) inadvertently creates a machine that replicates objects exactly. Angier employs this machine onstage (with blue bzzzz's galore, natch) to recreate Borden's Transported Man illusion as "real," appearing in two places simultaneously. The catch is: he must actually murder his replica every time he performs the act  to avoid hundreds of replicated Angiers. Now that's dark. And disturbingly amoral. And I love it.After the morbidity of Angier's chosen path, the movie ramps to an even darker conclusion, with the beauty of this tale's denouement lying not in its twists but in the manner writer-director Christopher Nolan unties the tale's own inescapable knots and proves *himself* the greatest magician of the film as he artfully dodges glaring plot holes and loose ends with his snake-charming sleight of hand.(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)

In a time where the same ideas are rehashed, The Prestige brings the age old revenge story into a refreshing and consuming light. The movie, though long, keeps the viewers' attention and has every mind trying to figure out the story before it even comes to an end, however, a second viewing of the movie might prove better than the first; for those who love to solve mysteries. Upon the second viewing is when subtle clues become more clear and the ending of the film becomes much more believable. A great story is only great when it can be told and seen more than once, and the Prestige gives its audience more than enough fuel to suggest it to other movie goers, and of course, attend the movie with them.

was a brilliant movie!!! beginning was a bit slow but yes very good. it was hard to understand though the ending. a quite confusing film but thats what made it so great. i don't recommend it for those who want a simple film as it is far from it. its not like those straight forward type films, in which a simpleton could understand. there are dark aspects to it which could shake up people but it gives it that suspense feel which makes you want to watch more. i was sort of put off with the film at first as it was a very boring start. it doesn't attract audiences to stay and watch the film, but lucky i did. like other film this has a slow start which may put you off but i do say that you must stay and watch the rest. overall i think everyone should watch it, it does give you different sort of movie.

The movie is riveting! There are twists and turns throughout the movie. You always feel as if you are there instead of watching. Michael Cane, Christian Bale, and Hugh Jackman do an excellent job portraying their characters. All 3 of them are very believable and were born to play these roles. Christopher Nolan does a fantastic job directing the movie as well. I thought this movie was so good, i plan on buying it on DVD. When you see this movie, pay close attention; it is one of those movies where every detail is there for a reason. Your eyes will be glued to the screen the entire time. I saw the movie, left, and continued talking about it the rest of the week. The movie is incredible. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.

Nolan film, check. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are the two main stars, check. A fantastic supporting cast, check. A gripping plot and subplots, check check. A worthwhile two hours, check. What more do you need?Borden (Bale) and Angier (Jackman), two appealing magicians with so much potential, begin with a respectful and trustworthy friendship and end with feelings of mutual hatred and competitive streaks. Their aim to out-perform one another ends in occurrences of violence, conflict and tragedy. You see to the full extent how people are capable of abusing their own power for selfish gain and how extreme the effects can be on the people themselves and on those around them.**MAJOR SPOILERS** The love interests, Olivia (Scarlett Johansson), Sarah (Rebecca Hall) and Julia (Piper Perabo) all stand at the heart of the magicians' competition and exploitation. Angier's need for revenge on Borden for the death of his wife involves him using new assistant Olivia as a way to discover Borden's latest and most genius trick which involves opening one door and coming out another. However, what he doesn't expect is Olivia falling out of love with him and in love with his sworn enemy, Borden. What this foreshadows is the tragic death of Borden's wife Sarah, who believed him to have had an affair with Olivia and loved magic more than her, when in fact there had been two Bordens all along - one loving one woman and one loving the other. Angier believes he has won - he has stolen Borden's daughter and put the wheels in motion for him to be hanged - but what he doesn't embark upon is that there is another Borden, the one who loved Sarah, still around and who ends up killing Angier. Of course, nothing is as it seems and the story doesn't end there - there are plenty more Angiers to go around... **END MAJOR SPOILERS**I'd seriously advise many people to see this movie more than once, it really is that superb. However, there are some scenes of violence and the mood is very dark overall so I wouldn't recommend it to children below 14. Nolan, Bale and Jackman fans in particular won't be disappointed as this film marks what is possibly their greatest talents and performances so far. Michael Caine plays the stereotypical sidekick always around for advice and yet pulls the part off as usual, with Scarlett Johansson making the best of what she can out of being the shared love between the two protagonists. Watch out for memorable appearances by Andy Serkis (who never disappoints) and David Bowie who is surprisingly good in his role.I give this movie 10/10 without a doubt. Arguably the plot goings-on are complicated but if anyone expected different, then they're missing the whole point of the The Prestige. Are you watching closely, asks Borden? I was. And I loved every minute.

I am not one to recommend any movie to anyone because I have eclectic taste when it comes to everything. HOWEVER, this movie is incredible! The visuals are stunning, the twists are perplexing, and I applaud the costume designer for an incredible job presenting the time period without being over-the-top. What an amazing story line with the right combination of love, hate, science, magic, action and adventure! Fewer movies are being created with the energy and passion of The Prestige. Not a line or shot is wasted - and the 2+ hours run time flies by. For me, it was truly a pleasure to see David Bowie back on the big screen and playing such a key role. Of course, Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are wonderful eye candy - but the depth of each of their characters draws you in as well. Perfect in every way - and in my top 10 movies of all-time!

This is a milestone for me. I don't think I've ever seen two movies in a YEAR that I thought were utterly perfect, and here I am writing a review about my second in a month.This is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen, and I'm SO glad I experienced it on the big screen. It was a compelling story, beautifully scripted and filmed, brilliantly acted by Jackman, Bale and Caine (I like that Bale's name was Alfred this time, like Caine's was in Batman Begins). Bowie was really restrained as Nikola Tesla, and I even liked Scarlet Johannsen (that lucky, lucky, LUCKY lady...getting to cozy up to both Jackman AND Bale? Sigh). However, her role, Alfred's wife, and Andy Serkis's character could have been played by anybody. I'm not sure any of them are worthy of special mention. And regarding Serkis, all I could think of was "my preciousssssssssssssss." This is a movie about misdirection, and I was surprised often by the twists and turns...a rare feat for a film. I kept trying to guess where it was going and I was either partially or completely wrong almost every time. There were only 2 parts where I guessed what was coming, and I LOVED that. It was really a clever movie.After a first viewing, there are only a couple of things about this film that I didn't find utterly satisfying. One is the fact that the last fifteen minutes or so played out as though the people associated with the creation of it suddenly assumed that the viewer's brain had stopped functioning. The rest of the movie dances along just out of your full reach, begging you to keep up, waving and sticking its tongue out if you don't, then screeches to a grinding halt while two characters suddenly start explaining away every minute of the previous two hours.I didn't mark the movie down because of this. The concepts were too intriguing, the intellectual and cinematic pace of the movie moving too precisely...there are fundamentally no dead spots in this film.I wouldn't have answered ALL the questions at the end, were it my decision. I would have left at least a few questions unanswered.**************BIG SPOILER HERE***************My only other problem with this film is the question of "which knot." That could have been easily ascertained when the ropes were untied and removed from the body.*****************OKAY DONE WITH SPOILERS*******************However, those things said, I still can't recommend this movie highly enough. If it isn't nominated for at least a few Oscars, I'll be seriously questioning the sanity of the Academy Members. This film was very cerebral (a rarity when coupled with "mainstream" and big budget"), and I hope it gets the industry recognition that it surely deserves. It's a quality film, and that is a sublime understatement.I highly recommend this film. Enjoy.

Excellent movie; ingenious plot line, unbelievable twists, and spectacular acting. The name of the movie, "The Prestige," has nothing to do with the level of prestige involved in the magician's competition; it references the third part of a magic trick. Through the course of the movie, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) attempts to discover the secret to Alfred Borden's (Christian Bale) latest greatest trick. There is a mysterious element to the antics of Borden much like the mysteries in an M. Night Shyamalan film. The plot is very complex, and I found that the plot made much more sense after I was able to discuss it with a group of friends who had also seen the film. One unique feature that I very much enjoyed was the strong lack of distinction in protagonist and antagonist. Rivals Angier and Borden both bring in their own share of criminal acts and charitable deeds. The science techniques employed by the characters in the movie are phenomenal, but completely unexplainable. All in all, this movie really gives the viewer something to chew on. I highly recommend it.

I went to see the prestige expecting to see a good movie, what i didn't expect was to be totally blown away by what i think is the best movie I've seen in a long time. as a mater of fact its easily one of the top 5 movies I've seen in my life. The story telling is fantastic memorising you from the very instant to the end of the fantastic dark conclusion. it was great to see finally a movie of this calibre come onto the screen as im sure every one is sick of the rubbish that has been shown of late. obviously once again portions of the movie have been made to try and imitate or copy the powers of steve and steve's powers of the trevix. we must all realise that although many people have tried unsuccessfully, delving into the powers of trevix is dangerous and steve and steve's powers cannot be matched by anyone on this universe or any other... they are genuinely the super powers from the planet trevixon

I am a person that is normally into sports movies and ones with a lot of action and hype. I went with my friend to see this movie who had watched Memento before and said it was good, so I figured he was right because he normally is, and this was directed by the same person so we checked it out. As soon as we started to leave the theater, we both decided this was the best movie that any of us had ever seen and we are going to see it for a fourth time tomorrow. Each time we see it, it stays just as good as the first time. It is the type of movie that you could watch 10 times in a day, and it would be just as good the tenth time as it was the first. I cannot wait for this movie to come out onto DVD. I would buy it at any price they set it at on the very first day it comes out. If you have yet to see this movie, just watch it and you will feel the same way.

I really hope The Prestige features heavily at the Oscars this year as it deserves to. It was an absolutely wonderful film that had everything.My very favourite thing about this film was that every little quirk was explained, but subtly, and that despite all the twists and denouements, it remained utterly conceivable and not in the least bit cheesy. The acting was superb throughout, and we were brought back to what was a truly exciting part of English history.Having re-watched the trailer, it is obvious that this would be an ideal film to watch twice as almost every line refers directly and cleverly to something that is revealed later on in the film. Watch it twice, you will see what I mean!

I have just seen this eagerly awaited film and have read many reviews so I sat down to watch and make up my own mind about the film. I DID WATCH AND VERY CLOSELY and found myself sitting on the edge of my seat most of the time wondering just where I would not quite get it right. I found the story fascinating and followed it to the end and it was then that I found I had been misdirected at some point - very cleaver.Christopher Nolan's directing and the shared script with his brother was fist class. His next inspiration was to pit Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale against each other - brilliant. Hugh Jackman as the showman who puts his magic across with pure showmanship but Chritian Bale is the better magician but they are friends - but I found him to be evil. But they bounced off each other all the way through and it was a joy to watch such talents on the screen. Michael Caine of course was excellent as ever but I am still confused about all the fuss in respect of Scarlet's acting abilities. I have seen two films and - no - to me she was the limp non person in the film.However, I thought that Hugh Jakman's performance was first class and he changed his main character so much as he started at the beginning of the film has a happy married man with his wife as his assistant but when she died he gradually became bitter, revengeful and obsessed with his magic against Bale because he was sure,and he was right that Bale was responsible for her death. But addition to that he play other characters and each with a difference each with that magical characterisation touch. Christian Bale was good his part but he did not have to progress or diverse as much as Hugh as he was himself and his own brother. He actually was the evil one because he knew he had tied the wrong knot and he was responsible for Hugh's wife's death which began the ultimate feud which would cause death.I was with Hugh all the way through and knew he was not dead - somehow ! Nothing was given away it was just a feeling and when he was shot by Bale it was such a shock I felt myself gasp and shocked this I did not expect.I suppose deeper thought from me should have realised that Bale had a brother because of 'I love you today' or 'Not today' As both magicians were such good friends I cannot understand why Hugh did not know about the brother.However I thoroughly enjoyed the film - I was delighted when it appeared that Bale would lose his daughter to Jackman but she would be well looked after by Hugh but I left the cinema feeling the good guy got the bad deal and the bad guy got away with murder twice - may be even three times really - he did drive his wife to suicide.I fully recommend this film to be seen - it is not complex if you watch it but I cannot guarantee that something will not trip you up and that is the best way a film should be and it is not often we get that delight.

Because of Christopher Nolan's Brilliant directing and Bales Oscar-worthing acting on "Batman Begins", I came to the cinema with huge expectations and they delivered in every possible way.I've never seen such brilliant actors these days with Hugh Jackman and Christian bale doing Oscar-worthy acting.Chris Nolans does it again with a unique direction to the film, the story and script have been clearly had a load of work on so that didn't fail and with so many twists to the story this makes this possibly the best film in a decade. It will face stiff competition from "Casino Royale" though 10/10This film deserves a an Oscar

Having watched several movies this year i have to say that so far this has to go to number 1 for 2006 i cannot think of another movie that has made me sit forward in the cinema. Nolan has once more provided another great film and i now eagerly anticipate the sequel to batman begins hoping that he has me edging out of my seat once more. I cannot think of two performances in a movie that contrast so well as Jackman's's and bale's in the prestige and it is a compliment to their skill and the director Nolan. I also have to compliment the ending which was fascinatingly eerie and fulfilled the criteria of the film it was not a failed like that of the departed.

"Are you watching closely". The Prestige is the best film i have ever seen in the cinema. A film which has Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Micheal Caine and Scarlet Johansson is bound to be a shocker. This film is about two magicians trying to be the best by preforming the transporting man trick, but there's a twist. A very good twist which leaves you guessing all the way through. This film is very confusing, but at the end all the questions you had will be answered (hopefully). With brilliant performances from all the cast members this is a film which must be seen by anyone who loves mysteries and magical mayhem. So get up and walk down to your local cinema and watch The Prestige.

We begin, of course, at the end.And then, having seen just how bad things get, we rewind to the start and discover that they started off just as badly.Assistants stride onto the stage, help out with a few tricks, and take their exits. Behind every trick is a technician, levering the mystery into place Meanwhile, our two central characters, both heroes of their own stories, wave their hands in misdirection, causing appearances, disappearances and reappearances, oblivious to the price that even stage magicians must pay.And when we get back to the end, past all of the various detours, distractions, sound and fury, we discover that, well, magic is exactly what we've been told it is, sometimes death can kill you, and sometimes it can set you free.=== It hardly seems worthwhile telling you that Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall, David Bowie and a host of others give fantastic performances. Good enough that one of the people I was with didn't recognise David Bowie at all.Or that the Nolan brothers manage to one-up their previous collaboration Memento by presenting a film which, if anything, jumps around in time more, while remaining perfectly comprehensible and remains a mystery simply because we're never quite looking at the clues right in front of us.There wasn't, in fact, an instant, when I wasn't glued to the movie, trying to work out how it was done. But as one of the characters remarks in the film, if you tell people how a trick is done they aren't impressed - it's the misdirection that keeps them coming back for more.

The story is told by Cutter played by Michael Caine and it unfolds a bit confusing at first as Borden (Christian Bale) reads the journal of Angier (Hugh Jackman). Borden is reading of how Jackman is actually reading and translating his old diary of how he wielded his best magic trick ever. A trick that Angier will go to any length to recreate and claim his own.The pair first meet as young men, eager to become magicians in their own right working for a well established magician who likes to play it safe, recreating the tricks of others safely until a cruel twist of fate, and a knot actually claims the life of Angier's young wife in a death defying water stunt. Forever cursing and blaming Borden for tying the knot that may or may not have taken his wives life Angier vows to outdo Borden, even it if means going to hell and back himself.You could never in a million years guess how this film would end. Because the director himself has used the oldest magic tricks in the book to fool us. Mis-direction, disguise, entertaining and good old fashioned humour to divert us from the truth until the end of the movie when the twists, (yes more than one) are revealed. Leaving us breathless and in awe of how good a movie this actually is.Abrakadabra.

This film is why you go to the theater and then back and then another time. From the first to the last it delivers. With gorgeous design, utterly engrossing performances it never misses a beat. The brooding and darkness in places are deep but subtle and never overpower the story. I found myself turning the story and characters over and over in mind and even found my dreams influenced. Typically the impact of a film leaves me as soon as I walk out of the theater. I've not felt the impact of film in such a personal way since The Dead Poets Society. My one complaint is the non-linearity of the story in key places. It definitely takes multiple watchings (and multiple eyeballs) to catch all the twists and turns and a rewind control would be welcome. However I feel that to be a slight fault and for the academy to pass this one up without at least a nomination would be a unpardonable blunder.

I was amazed by this movie. Everything is done beautifully from the acting to the set to the costumes. You certainly feel like you're immersed in the story and you've gone back in time to the height of magic. I was a bit surprised by some of the secrets. I won't give anything away, but I'm good at guessing films and this one I only got about 50% correct, which is really low for me. Even if you are completely paying attention, it's sometimes difficult to keep up. I almost wanted to start taking notes in order to figure out what was going on. Every actor is amazing, and the plot twists will keep you on the edge of your seat. I was a bit surprised by the addition of a science fiction element, but it didn't detract from the story in the least. This is a wonderful film, and you'll certainly want to pay attention when the Professor asks "Are you watching closely?"

It has been a long time since I was as impressed by a movie as I was by this one. Stellar acting by everyone involved, a storyline that makes you think and a very intriguing plot. I'm usually pretty good at guessing the twist ending long before the end, sometimes even before I see the film, but I didn't guess it this time. The casting was just excellent. Everything flowed perfectly. Plenty of twists and turns without seeming ponderous. And the ending was tied up quite neatly, unlike many films that don't seem to know how to wrap themselves up when they have as much to tie together as this one. I can't rate this one highly enough. It is well worth the money paid to see it, and I am more than ready to pay to see it again.

From the acclaimed director of 'Memento' and 'Batman Begins' comes Christopher Nolan's latest masterpiece 'The Prestige'. Set primarily in late Victorian London the film encapsulates the era of contemporary science, the world of performance theatre and optical illusion.Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) start off as friends but soon become vicious rivals after the death of Angier's wife midway through a stunt. Angier blames Borden for her death but instead of seeking revenge, he develops a compulsive obsession with Borden's latest magical act: The Transported Man. This leads to the two men trying to out-do each other, resulting in sabotage and murder! The film is full of twists and turns that build up to a dramatic conclusion. Just as you think you've worked it all out, there is yet another twist. Something you could never imagine! Definitely one to watch for anyone that enjoys major twists. 'The Prestige' certainly ranks alongside films such as: 'The Sixth Sense' and 'The Others' in its trickery. However, even if you haven't seen the aforementioned films, 'The Prestige' is chock full of enough realistic special effects, drama, suspense and magic to sate the appetites of even the most picky of viewers.

OK so I have to admit that I am a big fan of Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale and well Scarlette Johanssan isn't all that bad to look at either. Oddly enough this movie just sort of crept up on me, hadn't heard much about it till release was right around the corner.Moved to Pakistan a while back so couldn't catch it in the theater and so had to wait till I could land a decent print of the movie on DVD (yes piracy is pretty common in these parts of the world). And let me tell you what a Movie!!!!!!!!!! Although I have to admit that I was able to predict certain key plot points in the movie, how Nolan manages to bring them to the surface is really where this movie stands out.The rivalry is set up well with the accidental death of Perabo's character and then its easy to see how Jackman's quest for revenge soon turns into an obsession with the trick.Its a rivalry of Kane and Able proportions, where although both characters are at a stage where confrontation is no longer necessary, but yet have feel this inexplicable need to hurt the other. Brilliant! Now moving on as soon as you know the multiplication aspect of the trick you know that Jackman's looking to pull a coupe by sending his arch nemesis to the gallows and taking two things most precious to him -his trick and his daughter - in descending order of importance.Alhthough I caught on a bit early into the movie I still was hooked because i was curious to know how everything would play out. There was enough in the movie to keep me entertained until the end, and then it becomes all the More apparent that this is no mere pop-corn entertainer... this is more...so much more...Another thing that stands out is the fact that you really find it hard to sympathize with either character... its tough to pick sides... perhaps Jackman in the initial stages... but over time his character degrades to such an extent to find any justification for his actions is impossible...as is demonstrated by his camp follower Michael Caine's eventual turning.And then the final scene... right at the end when you think its all over... and think that they both got what they deserved... well one of the Bale's anyways... you get a glimpse of something in the box and you leave the theater in my case the home theater in awe and then you put another pack of popcorn in the microwave and head back to the front row seats so a repeat...

"The Prestige" is a film about two magicians who are friends at first but when a tragedy strikes, the two split up and have their own magic acts. A rivalry begins between them and from there, the movie twists and turns like a windy road.The acting is the strongest point of the film. Jackman and Bale are both charismatic and extremely likable, although I'll admit I was cheering for Bale (Who wasn't? :P). The plot is well developed and some have complained about the length but when you have a good movie playing, you don't notice the time. Once the movie grabs you, it doesn't let go.Definitely worth the admission price. Go see it, tell your friends, and you'll thank me later.

This movie is really well done in a lot of aspects outlined by other posters. However, it is definitely not for all ages. This is the kind of movie that parents will take their third graders to and then their teachers have to listen to them talk about their nightmares for the next several weeks. I work in a school, and it happens more often than you think.If you go see this movie, do your children a favor and leave them at home with a good sitter and a more age appropriate movie. It's rated PG-13 for good reasons. My husband and I had our viewing interrupted by more than one crying child, it was appalling that people would expose small children to a show like that. If you think your kids will be OK with it, go watch it first and decide if the actual content is really OK.

...Okay I know thats saying much but I mean it... I have watched a lot of movies, new and old. Like most anyone, I really like this movie. I'm not sure why it was rated PG-13...but then again it couldn't as well have been rated PG.... but I saw nothing in it that was PG-13 Worthy... Seeing how mostly PG-13 movies now and days can slip one "F" word in the movie... I was searching hard to try and find this one... and I could not. I do remember hearing a few words but no one seems to really care about it as much. But as for the speech that was good. The story was great! It kept you guessing and wondering what was going on. I love that aboot a movie!! :) I was on the edge of my seat the whole time... the story was just amazing and left you so ... just amazingly lost!!!If you love magic or love to know how things are done.. Here is a great twist for you...watch and fall in love with the thrill and mystery of the whole movie!... In Short... I love love LOVE the Prestige!

Without the knowledge that the director is trying to deceive the audience, you wouldn't have the large contingent of people saying "I figured it out, so it's not worth watching." I figured out the ending of this movie before the movie ended. Well, I figured out most of it; there are a few twists and turns that you pretty much can't predict. The beauty of this movie is that, even when you've figured it out (and you might, if you try, but where's the fun in that?), watching two dudes be completely obsessed with a competition--and with revenge--remains compelling.Other complaints--that the characters are cold--gets at the very nature of obsession. One of the many brilliant facets of this movie: three-dimensional characters Become one-dimensional as they are consumed by their obsession.In summary, holy crap this movie was awesome.

There are few movies throughout the world that can really give you a great show and this is one of those films.The prestige is one of the few films that i have really grown attached to as i was watching it. It provided an excellent and powerful plot and Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Michael Caine had truly proved that they are some of the very best actors in the acting industry today. It is those three actors at their very very best. I do however, have to admit that it was one of the most confusing movies i have seen but after watching it a second time I got exactly what had happened. But if you truly want to see a great movie and you are a big fan of magic tricks I strongly suggest that you see this movie as soon as possible.

"The Prestige" by Brian Murphy"The Prestige," a Victorian-era set film about dueling magicians, is much darker than "The Illusionist," the recently released magician film starring Ed Norton. It is a startling, sometimes violent study of rivalry, jealousy and obsession. Deftly directed and sharply written (along with his brother Jonathan Nolan) by Christopher Nolan ("Memento," "Batman Begins"), the story follows the lives of friends-turned-rivals Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale). Their unrelenting quest to be the best has profound effects on their entire adult life. "The Prestige" hooks us right away, with an intriguing shot of a hill littered with top hats. Without explanation, the multi-narrated film begins its first voice over as trick contraption designer Cutter (Michael Caine, terrific again) describes the three stages of a magic trick: The pledge, the turn and the prestige. The devious Nolan brothers have crafted their story to play out with a magic trick, setting out to trick us at the film's end. Despite some meandering scenes and revenge plots that may eventually seem repetitive, when the final surprise is finally sprung, the effect is chilling, whether we have guessed the outcome correctly or not. Narrative structure is bent, as past, present and future become a multi-layered collage that Christopher Nolan expresses with stunning clarity. Whatever points in Robert's or Alfred's lives are given screen time are distinguished with ease, whereas a lesser director would have muddled them. Robert and Alfred, apprentices working for the same magician. Despite a cordial rapport, both seem to have different ideas about what makes a good magic trick, with Alfred always seeming to have the idea of pushing things further. After ignoring Cutter's advice for how to tie a knot proper for Magician Assistant Julia, the woman dies in a water tank, and Alfred is responsible. Julia was Robert's wife, thus spawning the heated, perhaps even murderous rivalry that is to comprise the rest of the film. The Nolan Brothers have done their research, dissecting several, intricate magic tricks and revealing them to the audience. From the "Bullet Catch" to the "Disappearing Man," all angles are dispelled, and Robert and Alfred stop at nothing to sabotage their enemy from completing either trick. Even the bit players offer some spice, such as Scarlett Johansson as Robert's assistant Olivia, who may or may not be playing one side against the other. Rebecca Hall is outstanding as Alfred's wife, Sarah, her performance reminiscent of some of the outstanding, tough performances given by many of the women on HBO's "Deadwood." Sarah's feelings towards Alfred begin with intrigue, melt into love, and almost slip into madness trying to understand Alfred's split personalities-loving husband one day, obsessed magician the next. The lines in this film are as shadowy as Wally Pfister's cinematography, where our allegiance is deliberately forced to shift from one magician to the next, a testament to both good writing, and to the outstanding performances of Mr. Bale and Mr. Jackman. Both characters are, at times, valiant heroes and vile villains. Like "Memento," picking apart the plot of "The Prestige" may uncover some holes, but the overall effect is an exhilarating whirlwind of mystery, suspense and shocking revelations that are bound to have audience members discussing motives and theories long after the credits have stopped rolling.

This was an EXCELLENT movie!! One of the best I've seen. This is my favorite movie of all time. With suspense, unpredictable plot, and a touch of romance has made this movie a movie for every type of person. If you already love Christian Bale this movie will make you love him even more. The writers are absolute GENIUS'S!!! They wrote this movie amazingly! Even throughout all the twists they made it perfectly plausible and fairly easily understood. I think I'm going to write to the writers congratulating them on such an EXCELLENT movie. Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Scarlet Johannson, and Michael Caine, did a SUPERB job. They timed everything perfectly, and the emotion was entirely believable. There were multiple quotes that I will remember for a very long time they were just so GOOD! On the drive home after seeing this movie you will just not be able to stop talking about it. Throughout the seemingly serious plot, there are several parts that will just make you laugh out loud. All in all this was a SUPERB movie!! Not one even close to being as good! TWO THUMBS UP!

throughout the whole movie i was extremely confused and I'm still confused right now about it. however, the movie is wonderful. with the bits and parts that i do understand it is an absolutely amazing movie with so many twists and turns that will keep you on the edge of you seat until the movie is over and the crowd has shuffled out.The acting is wonderful and the directing makes you feel as if the movie is written just for you.i highly recommend this movie to anybody who is in the mood for a twist and a movie that requires a lot of thought, but yet a lot of excitement at the same time.

First of all, I didn't want to write twin/clone argument in the title because of the spoiler aspect......without having seen the movie, my title above doesn't mean anything to anyone glancing at the comments' titles which inevitably happens.I have read quite a bit about the argument between the twin and the clone of Borden/Fallon argument and I am leaning towards the clone angle. I have a lot of speculation that helps my theory and I look forward to responses.My absolute main reason for writing this is because I have a hard time swallowing the coincidence of Borden sending Angier on a wild goose chase halfway across the world to get some goofy flashing lights stage prop.......and then that same person being the ONE SINGLE PERSON IN THE WORLD who could have also coincidentally provided the entire cloning device solution and given Angier what he wanted in the first place... Now most of the evidence in the movie points to this theory and I can accept that.....but for me, it makes the movie far worse than I expect it to be. I mean, come on....we see coincidences in movies all the time, but they are more along the lines of two people passing each other on a street or groups of individuals all converging on a single spot at the same time..........but here we are led to believe that the protagonist {sort of} (Borden) sends the antagonist {again, sort of} (Angier) to the one single individual capable of solving his request when it was really meant to be a diversionary tactic to get Angier out of the country??? Come on.......that's too much for me to swallow. So here's some of my arguments against the other arguments out there in favor of the "twin" angle.First of all, I feel that Borden has had prior dealings with Tesla in some form or another. When Tesla is in England giving his demonstration, Borden seems to be the only calm one there, meaning he knows the lightning and experiments are harmless....at least the ones being shown at that time. Normally, he should have been as cautious as everyone else and left...if he was a normally sane person...which can be argued.Secondly...his clone could have come from a couple of years ago...OBVIOUSLY before his hand was maimed. And in doing so, he has to do the same to the clone's hand.Twins, at best, are still brothers. And we are supposedly led to believe that the twin brother (Fallon) has given up his whole life...his ENTIRE IDENTITY...for the sake of the other brother's magic show? The idea also that there's absolutely no difference in them other than the hand issue (during that point in their lives) which they end up fixing by chopping the others' fingers off, says that they are SOOOO identical that even the wife and girlfriend and others around them can't figure it out? Twins who live and grow up and experience different lives, or even similar existences, still exhibit physical differences, if nothing else but cuts or scratches leading to scars the other one might not have due to sheer different physical experiences through life. Also, the idea that the personalities are different can be explained by this same theory.....that the clone finding out he is a clone could exhibit a darker personality (maybe even a side effect of the cloning?) that would lend itself to the different personalities that come from living slightly different realities, even though the lives are nearly identical. Surely the darker personality would start holding resentment for ever being cloned....or maybe it's the opposite.....maybe the darker personality is the original Borden and the clone is a more "innocent" version (like an infant or a clone that is newly born) that lacks the dark tendencies....who knows. But if the clone is a couple of years old regardless of which personality it is.....it could exhibit a slightly different personality than the original strictly due again to different daily experiences through environment and luck among other reasons.CONTINUED IN PART TWO

When compared to the vastly better THE ILLUSIONIST, this film pales. I found myself actually being bored and kept waiting for something, anything to capture my imagination....to wow me. As an audience, the narrator within the film urges us to pay attention, and I did, for the duration - wondering why I didn't go to see another movie. The only real acting in the film was done by the character of Bale's wife in the film. Her scenes were touching...the rest...well lets just the ticket seller was the only one in the theater working slight of hand. Count me completely unimpressed.Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman were just OK, Michael Caine passable, and Scarlett forgettable. The only thing I can say about this movie is that its about obsession and the damage it can cause. Sorry, nothing magical about that!

There is not much to say about this movie. Is one of those you just keep going back and rewatch every year and it never gets old. Fenomenal movie all around.

The Prestige has a magnificent story full of plot twists. The storytelling is amazing, how it plays with words and your mind, just brilliant. All actors' performances are outstanding, but I admired Christian Bale the most. Cinematography and the atmosphere created is marvelous. Worth to watch more than once.

"Nolan's use The Prestige timeline like his incredible "Memento" which is risky for some of the people but gladly not for me, with the incredible perfomance by everybody, with a great double-twist that in the end make The Prestige is a totally make sense story, using double-twist that have been use before in "The Usual Suspect" which have a crime theme is i think easier to make, but for a movie that a have theme like this it's totally not easy and Nolan's makes that so well, overall The Prestige is just another great work by Christopher Nolan, i highly recommended"

How can I write reviews for Christopher Nolan Movies. Just watch it and experience it.

Great movie with super acting. Loved it. One of the finest art by nolan .

The best movie i've ever seen!!!
Great performance with a unbelievable ending!!!

When you get Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Scarlett Johansson, David Bowie, Michael Caine and Andy Serkis in one film, how can it not be great. It's an amazing cast! As well as a great cast, this film has a really interesting story. The back and forth between Jackman and Bale is really good, with each one hating the other and trying to prove themselves more skilled.My one complaint is the twist ending, is it really a twist? I suppose it is. I did see it coming from the moment we saw the hats and while it is good in terms of the story, it is very obvious. If you like Nolan you'll love this film, and even if you don't like Nolan this film is definitely worth a watch.

Christopher Nolan is definitely the best movie director ever. This movie confirmed it for me. He is a genius, and all of his movies are amazing and mindblowing (well except for the recent DC movies he had to direct, aka justice league and batman vs superman) I love interstellar, inception, tenet, batman begins, and the prestige. Can't wait to watch his other movies, memento, the other dark knight movies, and his upcoming movie reminiscence. this is on amazon prime, so if you have amazon prime, watch this ASAP

The starting of the movie was really boring to be honest but as I get more deeper the story comes alive to me. And twist in the last part just made me speechless. I was on that movie about a week, just did some research and watched it back over and over again.

This movie is a fine example of what master storytelling is all about. Twist after twist, this will keep your engaged. At times, you will feel like your have figured about the twist but the next minute, your will question yourself if that is really it.
Watch it right now. It deserved to be watched by every movie lover.

Basically a movie about some these guys who destroy the lives of everyone they meet because they can't come to terms with how in love they are. Hopefully neither got custody of the kid. Pretty messed up all around. Still a fun watch though so 7/10

Overall, The Prestige is a mind-boggling but special film. Christopher Nolan performs his own magic on the audience by consuming us in a world that is filled with twists and turns at every corner. Everything about the film is genius in my view, although it will take multiple viewings to fully understand the point of the film. However, when I understood what had happened, I has amazed. The performances, music, writing is superb, and this is a very underrated film that is not talked about in the way other Nolan films are. This is a great film that every film lover should see, go treat yourself!Quote - "Obsession is a young man's game" - John CutterRating - 5/5

I watched this movie on 11 May 2020, the movie is really good.

The Prestige is a 2006 thriller starring Hugh Jackman, Scarlett Johansson and Christian Bale and its directed by Christopher Nolan. Two magicians seek out the perfect magic act which leads to tragedy with Robert Anglier(Jackman)'s wife (Piper Parabo) who dies during an act lead by Alfred Bodman(Bale). So the two magicians seek vengeance with each other. But is one of the magicians holding a secret?.The premise was very good,the acting was good and I really loved the twist with Christian Bale. If you love Now You See Me and The illusionist then do check it out.Also stars Andy Serkis,Micheal Caine and the late David Bowie.B+

It is one of the greatest mystery films. It is an underrated movie which must have more than 9 IMDB rating. The screenplay is very fantastic as the movie goes forward, the way the story revolved around two equally talented characters is exquisite. Just like other Christopher Nolan movies, it is a masterpiece.

The second time you watch it, it gets better. Watch closely

Honestly, I was not expecting a movie about magicians to be one of the best movies I've seen. All around excellent acting. I thought Hugh Jackman owned his role and Christian Bale was excellent as well. Did not expect to see David Bowie, either, that was an unexpected but awesome! The story was entertaining the whole way through, it always left me on my feet, wanting to figure out what was going to happen next. Christopher Nolan created the perfect balance of intrigue and confusion. Just watch this movie.

It was unpredictable, awesome and attractive . the last minutes of movie was very shocking and at the end i was very shocked and i was just staring at the monitor.

What an amazing film, well acted and well directed. The characters and the story were complex and I was always on my toes. Absolutely loved this movie.

Rarely seen such a good movie.. continuously entertaining with an amazing story line

The mysterious style of directing by Nolan never fails to entertain and interest me. Spectacular movie

Really good exactly what you'd expect from Christopher Nolan .

The movie was amazing! It took a little while to get in to it, but it was definitely worth it in the end! It has a super unexpected ending and has lots of twists you will never even imagine! It is an amazing movie with unpredicted turns- you will never guess who the villain truly is! I would recommend it to those who love mind boggling movies!

Just what you wnat from Nolan .
The plot twists and how he makes you concentrate on the details is just beautiful in this Movie .
Definitely deserves your time

Nolan's masterful film illustrates the perception and science behind magic in a meaningful way. Borden and Angier are antagonists throughout the film; not as magicians, but also their different perceptions of life. Borden seems to be one step ahead of Angier and has a family; whereas, Angier has anger towards Borden regarding the accident that caused his wife's life and holds Borden accountable for it. Angier holds her dear in her heart and carries the name " The Great Danton " as his deceased wife once advised. Angier tries desperately to debunk his secrets and even meets Tesla.As time unravels and both have a double, what separates the two is that Borden's double is actually his twin brother; whereas Angier's double is a drunkard that is untrustworthy. The ending was remarkably made. My favorite quote within the great film by Mr. Nolan is what Angier's dying words were to Borden " You never understood why we did this. The audience knows the truth: the world is simple. It's miserable, solid all the way through. But if you could fool them, even for a second, then you can make them wonder, and then you... then you got to see something really special."Angier had passion for his job which is what he shared with Borden. However, his pain after the lost of wife haunted him and all he had left was to amaze the audience; that is what kept him alive. A great film with many aspects not just about magic, but also life.

POSITIVES:1) The performances of Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Rebecca Hall and Michael Caine are all extraordinary, good support from Serkis and Bowie too. Jackman in particular gives a career best performance in my opinion.
2) The themes of rivalry and obsession and work life vs family life are all portrayed fantastically
3) The ending reveal is magnificent and every time you rewatch the film you see another clue to the ending that shows you that, just like Michael Caine's narration states, you couldn't figure the trick out because before it was explained to you you wanted to be fooled!!
4) The cinematography goes largely unnoticed but some of the shots are absolutely beautifulNEGATIVES:1) Scarlett Johansson is miscast in my opinion and her London accent is shocking and just stereotypical
2) While the first act and third act are flawless, the second act just drags a bit for me. I don't think it's necessary to see slightly different versions of the same trick being performed over and over again, which is largely what the second act consists of with the metal rings, the bird cage, the catching a bullet and the transported man
3) Why couldn't the Borden that loved Olivia always be with Olivia and the Borden that loved Sarah always be with Sarah? Wouldn't that make the facade that the two Bordens are portraying seem more believable and less likely to get caught out?

This movie one of the best movie i ever watch.
it is a masterpiece like the nolan's other films

This movie is just magnificent ,every few minutes it had me making theories about the plot "Tesla tricked him!" , "Cutter works for Alfred!" , "he stole the machine!" constantly , this film had me so invested and captivated in what was happening I really felt as if I lived in Victorian London and as if it was my hand that had been shot or that it was me who would never see my daughter again. This film does an incredible job of immersing the viewer. A large component of this movie , and of most of Nolan's , is that there are constant plot twists. Another film with this many twists and ould get convoluted and confusing very quickly but this would does an excellent job of both keeping you guessing and keeping you informed.

This movie now absolute brilliance by Christopher Nolan, every single one of the actors make a great role. It's probably the best movie about Magic, it should be a 10 out of 10 or at the very minimum 9 out of 10. Even David Bowie is in this movie.

It is the best movie ever. i think ieveryone should watch this movie

One took turns to enjoy the cheers and applause with his compatriots and brothers, and the other self sacrifice and self destruction made the replica continue its artistic life. Human nature is dying out in fanaticism.

It's a great movie to show the struggle between two magicians.The magic is very mysterious, adding a lot of mystery to the film. I don ' t understand the fact that Angel finally killed another one. How did the other Angel come from? The point is that you are eager to be deceived by the plot from the beginning. When you are completely caught in a scam, what you see is only what the director wants you to see. This is also the greatness of the film. Nolan has the same level of control over the mood of watching movies as Hitchcock!

The Prestige revolves around three primary aspects; the pledge, the turn and lastly, the prestige. The movie starts off with a sense of unity and deception, but only towards the audience, however as the movie climaxes the characters are no longer united, and in the process of deceiving the audience the characters end up deceiving themselves. Particularly, Robert Angie, Hugh Jackman's character, loses himself in his bitter rivalry with Aflred Bowen which began as a result of his wife's tragic death. While the rivalry wasn't a direct result of his wife's death, it was an outcome of pure stubbornness and simply an avoidable act. But this alone wasn't the pure cause of the hatred, no, it all came down to simply one word, neglect. Bowens inability to accept the blame, while a part of him knew it was him, was the real cause of her death but his answer remained, " I don't know".The pledge of Angier's act remained transparent to the audience, however the character himself remained an utter mystery to the audience until his last act, the prestige, where he was exposed. Focusing on the act, Angier took something relatively ordinary and presented it to the audience to show that it was indeed real, however what would the audience expect even if it wasn't, it was their first time seeing an object like it. As Angier received the audiences' approval, he was able to move onto his next act.The turn, during this act the audience is still aware of what is happening, the magician is still present but as soon as he disappears, that's when the real act takes place. The audience are left to their imagination, remaining curious of what has happened to him; some may wonder if he died?, others may ask if the act had gone wrong? Or simply what should they expect. To explain this act, the magician takes some ordinary and makes it do something extraordinary. The audiences' mixed emotions of fear and curiosity sets the perfect stage for the last act to take place.The prestige, now this specific part is the most crucial act of the trick. The prestige is responsible for providing that satisfaction both to the magician and the audience, because simply "making something disappear isn't enough, you have to bring it back". The Prestige was the most significant act of his trick, but it was also a gamble, always a test of his morals, of his bravery, something that would have defined a man, a magician, during the 1800s, when the movie was set.The plight of both magicians was that neither of them were aware of the boundaries. The boundaries of simple ethics; morals that help us live our day-to-day lives. The rivalry between the two magicians later led to a never ending set of competitions, one after one, for the sole purpose of getting even or being the 'better magician'. However, at the end, it was apparent who it was. The one while breaking the boundaries, while this may sound ironic or contradictory, he knew his limits, he didn't play the role of nature, he chose not to challenge God's duty. But there was a cost, a "sacrifice" that both magicians had to pay, whether it was sharing a life or losing a loved one, it was a consequence of their life, of their act because simply " no one wants to be the man in the box", they want to be the man on the stage, the one with the fame, the glory and the audience, because that's what really matters in the life of a magician, curiosity, curiosity for a secret they may never discover.

I loved the movie so much but it was little boring in the middle but the ending made me forget all what happened before and be amazed by the direction of the amazing man christofer Nolan and the adorable preformens of Hugh Jackman and christian bale and the writing of movie was unbelievable the ending is very shocking what a movie

If I watched this for the first time today I may feel differently. But I've loved this movie for a while and after seeing it again I went back and updated from 9 to 10 stars. There are a handful of movies that do not live up to the hype I placed on them when I was younger and when I rewatch a movie I usually expect to come away less excited about it than I was before. But I didn't get that with The Prestige. It has a couple of small imperfections and if you don't buy the Tesla mysticism I can see it being a dud. But I feel it's masterful. The exposition is well executed, the twist isn't cheap, I think the story is both engaging and well told. The story does jump back and forth but I've seen the movie enough to know what's going on.Anyway, I'm still impressed with this movie. Although I do have to turn subtitles on a couple of times to understand what's being said.

This movie is so special
From beginning to end It gives You Goosebumps
Everything about this movie is perfect 10/10
Directing
Cinematography
Acting
Story
Plot twists.
For me it is The best movie Nolan ever Directed and Far better than Original Novel.

It keeps going back and forth in time, must've been really hard to create.
If the ending was a happy ending I would've gaven it ten stars.

After reading it, I suddenly found that Tesla was like the role of "Devil" in Faustry. He appeared as if he were a god. There is a loyal and strange servant and a piece of "Cthulhu" or "Vampire". "The ordinary mansion, abandoned by the world, gave Jackman who sought his help in pursuit of the ultimate magic, and let Jackman lay down countless lives for it. Now it seems that the Tesla device has some" matches " "Peng" taste. However, Tesla and his servant Andy seem to be the only unsullied male characters in this film, and even Kane has become Jackman's "assistant" in the later period, such as helping him throw Bell into the coffin.There is very little description of magic in the whole film, and the magic that appears appears to be counted in one hand, so the whole film spends a lot of space describing the various conflicts between the two heroes around magic and life. The only thing to spit is that the two men It's a little too easy to dismantle the platform. You should consider not choosing "male with beard between 30 and 40 years old" when choosing volunteers. Jackman 's role plays are relatively numerous in this film, and because of Bell 's secrets, the story cannot be told from Bell 's main perspective. Only in the late stage of the film can Bell 's plays be increased. Of course, his secrets are relatively easy to guess. The trick is too easy to be seen by slightly experienced audiences. This kind of covert performance also leads to this. Maybe Bell 's partner is more diversified and more diversified, but it is more difficult to guess? This is also the most powerful secret of the film, so many characters are only seen by his wife, and all other characters seem to be not noticed by his daughter.Because the story was told from the perspective of Jackman in the early part of the film, he was initially a slightly positive image, and Bell was the death of his wife for his "selfish desires and overconfidence", and then Jackman's revenge also escalated the damage of the two. . Jackman was born in a musical, and he was handsome in a dress on the stage, so the film also made Jackman's stage performance exceed Bell. Bell's stage name is actually a "professor", and still in London, Holmes will demolish the stage. Right. Of course, female characters are more vase-shaped and tool-oriented because of the times, especially Scarlett. I have forgotten that she has also played this film. It is beautiful and really beautiful, with many close-ups. Wife Bell didn't have much impression, it seems that she doesn't play blockbuster much later. When I saw Tesla, I felt so temperamental, because my impression of Baoye was still his thin image when he was young. The dress of Baoye in this film is very "normal", without makeup and strange shapes. It is estimated that Bao He would n't agree if he did n't play TeslaTwo magicians are fighting, the only profit is probably the theater owner and the audience who have obtained a wonderful experience. The extraordinary people sacrifice themselves to obtain honorary money and self-satisfaction. I am a mortal who ca n't afford to sacrifice and mediocre, but can get their achievements. The short-lived happiness it brings is just like the movie.

In the world of magic, both the magician and the audience on the stage are immersed in the illusion of magic and can only choose to be the deceived person of magic. As the lines in the movie say: "Now you want to find out the secret, but you can't find it because you are not really watching. You don't really want to know, you want to be fooled

Not only is this one of Nolan's best works it's also one of Christian Bale's best performances! Highly recommend you give this movie a watch, the ending will catch you off guard if you aren't watching closely.

The point is that you have been eager to be deceived by the plot from the beginning. When you fall into a hoax completely, all you see is what the director wants you to see, which is also the greatest thing of this movie.

This movie starts with the introduction (1st Phase) of the Characters. It then destracts us by setting up the main theme of the movie as a rivalry (2nd Phase). After that it is revealed to us that Christian Bales Character is alive (The Prestige) and operated with a twin brother. Thus we get behind the trick that was done here. But as you might think the movie establishes a second trick much before you figure out the first. The Tesla Cloningdevice. It is first established to us (1st Phase) and then the effect is shown to our human eyes (2nd Phase). Lastly we see Hugh Jackmans Character once drowning and once reappearing (or the Hat, whatever). This is the Prestige.
So, the movie tricks us with its first trick right into the second, that it leaves unanswered. We can make up our own mind about it, but we're still left guessing, just like the perfect magic trick.

The best film i have ever seen. Definetly it deserves to be in the top 10.

A masterpiece. There is not a single second that doesn't make sense or is a contrivance.

Before the birth of movies, magic was probably the most magical entertainment in human society. However, the emergence of movies means that human vision has entered a more magical era. From this perspective, movies are undoubtedly another kind of magic. The prestige organically integrates the traditional entertainment of "magic" into the film, and allows the magic show to continuously drive the story forward. There is magic in the film, and beyond the magic is the film. The twin brother, the copy person and so on have the element of magical colour to also be mixed in among them, true true false, false true true, fell into a kind of inarticulate and inarticulate but meaningful ending finally in. Magic is deceptive, the movie is creating illusion, but in this unpredictable illusion, we can feel the infinite reality.

Nolan is simply the GOAT. Those turning points in his movies keeps leaving me wordless. Masterpiece from a genius.

The movie it self was a tough one to understand. Maybe the first 30 minutes are hard but once you figured out the characters, the plot, the background and so forth. You see nolan is responsible for a really good feature. Both Christian bale are hugh Jackman are fantastic in their portrayals and Michael Caine is even better. I really liked that even if it's not based on a true story then it involved real characters such as nicola Tesla and adison. Great portrayal of David Bowie. The plot is complicated but I enjoyed how the characters outsmarted each other in every occasion. Great job nolan.

If the magic in the magician is called magic, then the magic in this movie can only be called acrobatics. This movie is tearing through the magical secrets from beginning to end. All the mysteries are so bland after being broken, but they paid too much to know the bland results. At the last moments of the two magicians, I don't know if there will be remorse in their hearts. I guess they will regret it for a moment, but they will do it again. In one breath, it is sometimes harder to swallow than to swallow a bullet.

This movie... is cool. That's pretty much all I got.

Damnnnn.. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman
And Christopher Nolan.. These 3 names are enough for a movie to come out as a great one! And it actually was throughout the movie until the very end..twist after twists..and the revealing of Borden's "the transported man" was unexpected..like the answer was Infront of your eyes all the time but you could've never imagined it..just Nolan things..
But.... there's a but yeah..the whole cloning machine sci-fi thing just ruined the whole vibe for me..I was expecting something phenomenal not some sci-fi crap(I love sci-fi just not on this occasion) ..and what about Hugh Jackman getting shot at chest and still blabbering unnecessary cheesy cringy **intellectual** dialogues for minutes?..like HEY! Why this Bangla cinema? And... although Borden was portrayed as the **hero** at the end I would have to say he wasn't..Borden & Angier both were the villains of the story.there's no hero to begin with..Borden just got the best of Angier at the end...
overall I enjoyed this movie untill the end part..so it's a 10/10 for me for most of the movie until the end part and 5/10 for the ending sequence.. overall rating? Do your maths.. I don't wanna do it myself

Both a natural and supernatural mystery. One might expect one but not the other. Excellent cast. Great premise. But the reveal was both anticipated and obscured as the lines of the genres were blurred. I'll leave you to figure out this riddle. I give this film a 7 (good) out of 10. {Mystery Drama}

The movie is great, no doubts. Almost each element is perfect: filming, acting, pace, atmosphere.. The only flaw, imho, is the number of twists. There are movies that a single one does a fine job (e.g. The Entitled, 2011). But enough is enough, and Nolan serves even more. Otherwise the only fair note would be 10/10.

22 October 2006. The script is tight, covering almost all of its bases along with a tense and character-driven drama surrounding loss and revenge, prestige and sacrifice. While the relational dramas unfolding appeared somewhat chaotic, part is explained by the plot itself. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale provide was wonderful performances as well as the mysterious David Bowie as Mr. Tesla as an added bonus. There are a few harsh magical moments. The flashbacks are handled nicely without obvious ostentation except where appropriate for the character and context. The ambiguity of Jackman's and Bale's characters is also commendable. Overall, this is a fine movie, but there are a few editing jumps and a bit of underdevelopment of characters that could have provided full-rounded enjoyment. However, such trifles could come down to deliberate necessity because of the plot twists. A surprisingly eerie, compelling delight. Eight out of Ten Stars.

Rivalry between two magicians is a new concept explored by Christopher Nolan. It's originality is it's strength. It's weakness is it's predictability. Two and half hours long , but I still found this engaging till end. But the ending didn't go well with me. The ending is not exactly the ending . It gave away all the plot in about 2/3rd of movie. It was already known that Angier uses a double and that Borden must have used one . That double being a twin is not a surprise. And that the machine produces an another double is quite obvious when Angie dropped the hat and Tesla said 'All are yours'. And was it that difficult to tell Olivia that they were twins? Only good twist at the end was Angier being Lord Cadlow. I like the movie only for the first 110 minutes and not for the last 20. Due to Nolan's fine storytelling. The only bad part is when it tries to be intelligent without having that sort of story.

One can relate to this personal human struggle for victory over another at all costs on a much grander scale, as the two magicians could easily be symbolic of how leaders of countries come to blows with each other, at the expense of their women and children -- something we struggle with right now in our world. There are deeper layers of this film that will be uncovered over time. The movie was well acted, interesting, entertaining, visually stunning and the twist at the end was surprising. The Prestige definitely is one of the best movies about magicians. I found out about this movie on flickstree and flickstree is really good and helpful in finding movies of our choice.

As Christopher Nolan also directed Inception and Memento, it is no surprise that the Prestige is a complete mind-boggler. The Prestige is a great film because it is multi-layered, intricately written and demands the full attention of the viewer. It often cross-cuts back and forth between two separate narratives, which means you need to be completely engaged in the film or you'll end up confused. I've also never seen a film about magicians and showmanship before, so the Prestige opened up my eyes to a whole new film genre. Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson were all great as the leads.Read my full review here: http://goo.gl/4ZM11a

I have a particular perspective on this movie, being myself a stage hypnotist. Whilst my art is quite distinct from that of illusionists such as are depicted in this movie (although I have performed as such also) the two fields do overlap and in the broadest common usage I am often referred to as a magician. Many aspects of the story I found to resonate with me on a personal level.I emphasise the story because that is what sustains this production. I have'nt read the original (though I have earlier work by the same author) but the screenplay sustains attention through what might otherwise be judged an overlong piece. To be frank, the movie starts slowly and dwells excessively on many scenes, some of which are irrelevant to the plot and could have been omitted with no loss. For example the one with the prank on the prison warder.The sets, photography, costumes, performances are all excellent but one would not sit through it just for those aspects. Until the story cranked up some momentum I regarded the movie as yet another to make jokes about rather than being engaged by. Indeed I chuckled when a magicians "secret" is revealed in mysterious seclusion as what appears to be a gigantic metronome with its cover on(it isn't, but looks like one). The slow start is not entirely the directors fault and in this respect the writing falls short of its overall quality. Deliberate humour is actually one thing entirely absent from the movie, which may be appropriate given the dark subject matter. However, the early parts, with a story told using intercut viewpoints and time-frames, flash-backs and flash-forwards is really rather confusing.There are sub-texts in the story which extend beyond the immediate tale itself and these are subtly flagged up in the script. The ambiguity of identity is only the most obvious theme. The best feature of the realisation only become apparent when one has already watched it and the metaphors hidden in plain sight throughout become retrospectively apparent. In a way, this is something of a magic trick in itself. Perhaps the attention spent on what I have suggested to be "irrelevent" scenes are after all a kind of mis-direction. A kind of magic!

The Prestige follows two magicians over the course of their career. What started as a friendly rivalry turned into much more. Borden and Angier, the two main protagonists start off as stage hands to an experienced magician, but after a horrible accident in an illusion involving Angier's wife goes wrong and she ends up drowning. And so starts the battle between the two magicians, as the movie progresses through the years it shows just how desperate each one gets to outdo the other. Until one day Borden shows his audience his "Transported Man" trick, Angier's mind snaps. Little does he know that he's not really looking for the secret to Borden's trick, but trying hard to emulate and improve it. That's what the movie hides so well. The scenic landscape of Colorado and Colorado springs captured by excellent camera work helps bring the grandeur to the movie. It's not just the fancy footage filmed in the mountains and valleys that really make this film, it's the faithful recreation of late 19th century London which sets the dark undertone of the film. The inclusion of an all-star cast solidifies each character's performance and personality, especially the likes of Michael Caine and David Bowie. Obviously since this is a film about magicians, the "what happens next?" moment occurs quite frequently and it's not just limited to the tricks they perform. Music in a movie has always been extremely important to me. Fortunately in Nolan's flicks, one can find much to appreciate in how a certain suite or soundtrack really binds the scene together. Although the movie isn't noted for its soundtrack it was still important in completing the scenes. Nolan's movies sometimes have a tendency to have "empty" scenes, for me there were definitely a few scenes which I thought were just filler.

It happens with every Nolan movie. The guy can't do anything wrong. Of cause we've got to give credits to Christopher Priest who came up with a great story and Nolan's brother Jonathan for helping hem. So it's about a... I don't know... a war I guess between two magicians. One is more of a showman and the other is obsessed with tricks. Well don't get me wrong they both obsessed but Christian Bales character is really obsessed. So for the most part the story runs in London in 19 century. Oh yeah good old London. And it's great because the city is beautiful. So the plot is incredible. I know you've heared it a lot but there are twists after twists. And when you think that there possibly can't be more they give you more. So that's that. The acting is great again as always in Nolan's film. He knows who to hire. I liked Bale and Caine the most. They're great(did I say great like 3 times?) Special effects are good I guess. Well it's not Dark Knight nor Inception there aren't so much but those which are there are great. So yeah there you have it. Another masterpiece by Nolan.

The Prestige is one of the most well crafted movies I've ever seen and it kept me thinking the whole time. Once I thought I understood it, something else came along and changed that. This lasted throughout the whole film and it wasn't frustrating, but extremely intriguing. Pacing was really good and I never lost interest. The story was actually very interesting to me and nothing like I've seen before. The ideas were brilliant and gave the movie the character and spirit it had. Completely original and didn't take from anything else. The performances were great and totally fit with the ending. (You'll see what I mean when you watch) The movie was a magician's act itself, and I would love to see it more than once.

THE PRESTIGE is a fascinating, satisfying if flawed look at magicians and passion through the lens of a thinking man's director using details of turn of the century history as his palate. Most satisfying if you're up to following the unexpected details, but it must have been frustrating for the releasing studio to try and figure our how to SELL the film when it first came out.Is it a simple classic costume mystery? (It isn't) Do you give away that there may be science fiction elements? (They didn't - to even hint that there may have been some inspiration in the STAR TREK series and its fictional technology might have been a major spoiler, but without buying into that concept, the film has a serious logistic flaw - and the mere incorporation of references to the period science - heavily extrapolated - of Nicholas Tesla wasn't enough to get the point across for many) Are the great Hugh Jackman or Christian Bale big enough stars to simply sell it as a vehicle? (At that point they weren't) The film didn't find its initial audience and went to DVD all too soon, but it's rightly developing a fair cult now, because it IS a fascinating experience for audiences knowledgeable enough to bring at least some awareness of Nicholas Tesla (the Sci-Si Channel's great series EUREKA has helped a lot on this front), willing to actually pay attention to Nolan's complex story telling which uses the flash-back and flash-forward more effectively than most recent films, willing to take a leap of faith or two and anxious to enjoy the excellent work from a uniformly superb cast and director.It is all too tempting to see the first shadings of director Nolan's lighter but more complex "thinking man's extravaganza," INCEPTION, in THE PRESTIGE. Both are films which require an audience willing to pay full attention and actually LISTEN, not just lie back and wait for the car crashes and exploding buildings to entertain them. Both are stories which use the pain of lost love to unexpected advantage motivating their core characters. Both are immensely rewarding to those willing to THINK and not just absorb.In the film and real life "the prestige" is a magician's term for the final reveal which makes a trick pay off. On DVD, THE PRESTIGE is a prestige item serious film buffs will want to savor more than once.

Christopher Nolan always seems to satisfy us with a unique story or way of telling the story. In The Prestige, he does a bit of both. This film about competing magicians who grow increasingly contemptuous of each other is set during the spiritualist craze of Victorian London. Like a Sherlock Holmes story, it feeds us hidden clues carefully woven into its dialog and plot. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are equally compelling and reprehensible as the two competing magicians, and Piper Perabo and Rebecca Hall are the two hapless women in their respective lives. Michael Caine is the marketer and mentor of Hugh Jackman. Scarlett Johansson is the young girl who shifts from one to the other, playing an assistant and mistress. David Bowie is the enigmatic Tesla, disappearing almost completely into character. As with his last film, Batman Begins, Nolan's film contains sumptuous art and set direction, cinematography, and costumes. The soundtrack is also not intrusive, although the audibility of the dialog and volume of the sound throughout the film seem quite low. The film is Hitchcock-like in that its success relies more upon how its executed than individual actors and/or plot points. The film-maker tries distracting us like a magician with shifts in time and points of view changes. It's truly a mesmerizing, multi-layered, and thought-provoking film. Although the film's puzzle may ultimately be deciphered by the discerning viewer, it should not spoil the enjoyment the film provides. However, the fact the film is rated so high on the IMDb's top 250 list is more a tribute to the idea people like to be fooled than its greatness as a film. ***1/2 of 4 stars.

Besides the two main characters rivalry, and the notable overall Nolan's trick i d like to mention: -very suitable Scarlet Yohansson's acting cause it meant to be flat. (She's the blond assistant remember?!!). Watch out for her trick. -Kane is great cause his acting is suitable for someone who just cannot be the magician. Besides that he plays all the same to me. Every f. time. Anyway watch how works his trick in the plot as the assistant's above.SPOILER follows!The film was so compact! You can't take anything out. I ll only criticize Nolan on the bit early focusing on the engineer character. Too early focus i think.Anyway, among the best ever! dz

I have to say, when I walked into my local theater to see "The Prestige" I did not expect this film to be anything special, but I was taken for a huge surprise and I walked out with an indelible experience.The plot was wicked and suspenseful and fun to watch unfold, but even more watchable were most of the performances that rounded out the film, making it all the more worthwhile. My main reason for seeing this film was Christian Bale, who totally delivered, but so did Hugh Jackman (although I would have preferred if he kept an English accent the first half of the film), Michael Caine (no surprise there), as well as David Bowie (who did surprise me) and Rebecca Hall. Everyone was solid, except Miss Johansson who dished out an utterly unfulfilling and dull performance which went nowhere and did nothing for the movie.At any rate, the film was great and I'll definitely be going back to see this.

The Prestige was a wonderful movie. It had great actors, a great storyline (though sometimes kinda confusing), and was a great thriller. Although I knew the actors playing the characters, I was so into the movie I did not see Hugh Jackman or Christian Bale. I just saw their characters, and that means that they did a good job. I was always hooked on the storyline and was never bored throughout the whole story. I just wanted to see what would happen to the characters. My only problem was that it was kinda confusing. The good guy was the bad guy and vice versa, and the whole concept of cloning was tough to understand, but they ended it very well and in a way that I understood the whole thing. That whole day all I was thinking about was that movie.

BEST MOVIE EVER MADE!! If you are human you will love this movie. I can't believe even 1.1% of people thought this movie was awful this movie deserves a 73289754093 out of 10. If you want to see a movie that shows you the dangers of obsession, this is the movie for u (and also for people who don't want to see a movie about that.) Good for over people 12 and over. No sex scenes, but contains blood at times. There is no movie better than this one. After I watched it I watched another movie (Bridget's Jones's Diary) and I couldn't appreciate it because it just wasn't The Prestige. That is only bad part about it, I can never watch another movie in the same way. It will take Hollywood years to top it.

The Prestige is a movie done by the same man who did Memento and batman begins. It is a moderately dark tale of two magicians. I left the movie talking with friends about the intricate plot. Hugh Jackman and Christian bale play their roles superbly. The only fault is the characters not being particularly likable.However you forgive the writers towards the end. Hugh Jackman is very different from his role as wolverine. Anyone who has read the book by Christopher priest would not enjoy it as much. However the book presents an interesting viewpoint to the movie. David Bowie and Andy Serkis are funny. Andy Serkis longs for that cod piece so well known as Gollum's own. This movie i enjoyed because it is a clever roller-coaster ride of emotions. you feel great disgust for Hugh Jackman's character at the end. Him killing himself each night is a fantastic twist and the end part where you see the large amount of boxes filled with Hugh Jackman's body and Michael Caine's narration is fantastic. I felt that Hugh Jackman would be the good guy. And was surprised when he was evil

You won't have a problem paying close attention to this mesmerizing and sometimes shocking plot, but if your attention wanders even for a moment, you'll be lost in the end. I'm still explaining details to my husband of the unexpected ending, where and when the details were set up earlier, and how and why. He totally missed the fact that Borden was not the most evil after all, but that Angier was the worst of the two. He missed catching onto the fact that Borden had created his own double (a real twin?), but kept him around as a constant companion, confidante and equal partner - while Angier murdered each double immediately after the great trick was finished and his usefulness was ended.Few movies will succeed in keeping me in the dark for so long with their unpredictability, but this one surely did. I loved it.

I was intrigued with the trailers of this movie and thought they did it justice.Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale were excellent in their roles!I could almost feel their anguish and anger as each part of the movie unfolded.I was very pleased how they worked their diaries/journals into the plot with surprising results.Jealousy and hate were mixed in with their admiration of each other.Scarlett Johansen is remarkable in her role and is always a welcome addition to any successful movie.Michael Caine was wonderful and added beautifully to the support and the success of this movie.David Bowie was also a pleasant surprise. I feel he was highly believable as the reclusive scientific genius.In summation, I am happy to had the opportunity to view this movie. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves mystery and intrigue.

I saw this film this afternoon with an open-mind, having no clue as to what it was about it. Seeing a few of Chris Nolan's movies, I knew it was going to be good. Boy, it blew me way away! i'll try not to give too much of the story away, (for it is so cunning and amazing with scheming). It's about two magicians in competition (Jackman) and (Bale) who try to gain fortune and glory, but also learn and reveal to the masses of the ultimate magic trick. both set off in a face/off of lies, deceit, obsession, greed, pride, and murder that can lead to serious consequences. That's all I'm going to reveal of the story, for it is so cunning and amazing with scheming that when yo think you've figured it out...think again! It has a powerful all-star cast. Hugh Jacman and Christain Bale were an awesome couple of foes, who deserve some recognition in the Oscars. especially Jackman, for he plays a very ambivalent character; not to mention the rest, Scarlett Johansen was both good-looking and had talent, Michael Caine was absolutely fabulous, which he always was, and a surprise guest star of Andy Serkis was also really decent in his role.The film-making was mind-blowing, with realistic looking visual effects, that didn't look CGI, even though they probably were, the set-decoration and costume design, was vivid, and the music score gave a very depressing, but moving feeling, that made the film flow even more. However, the film made unexpected changes from scene to another with a lot of choppy editing, which came very untimely, making the film very confusing and hard to follow. The pace was also relatively slow, for the two hour film felt more like three hours.otherwise, this is one of this year's best films! it has pretty much everything a good film needs, acting, story, and film-making quality. Chris Nolan has pulled it off again! ***1/2 out of **** See it, it is worthwhile!

Since I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone who hasn't seen it yet, I will simply explain the basics. Two rival magicians compete with each other to see who is the better magician. Hugh Jackman's character becomes obsessed with one of Christian Bale's magic tricks and tries to discover Bale's method. Throughout the story, many twists and turns arise and I found the movie to get better as it went on. The acting was top-notch and the movie was executed wonderfully. However, the ending, which I will not divulge, had good aspects and bad. Still, the movie was so intriguing that it kept my interest the whole time. Some said that the movie was too long but I disagree. The two hours and fifteen minutes flew by. You should definitely see this movie which is one of the best of the year.

Okay, so everyone i know is raving about how good the prestige is. I admit myself that it looked really good on the trailers. Maybe its because i had such high expectations that i was so devastated by this terrible ending. If you've seen the movie you know the whole time everyone is questioning how the real transported man works. You keep wondering, if its not a double then HOW THE HECK IS THE TRICK DONE!?!!?!! Its a classic move, make a mystery the whole movie, and then when the explanation comes at the end everyone is amazed. This should be how it works. But the prestige ignores all convention and lays down that terrible terrible ending. The whole point of the movie is that you wonder how the trick is done. Then when they reveal it you are expecting some really cool trick. "how does the man make his body transport?" for some reason the answer to that question is: He simply clones himself and drowns himself every night! DUH! ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Im expecting some cool trick and the explanation of how he does the impossible trick is that he does an equally impossible thing. Thats not an explanation thats just another impossible thing. Thats like me making a movie where a certain person can come back from the dead and saying "okay the trick is that he can time travel and just avoid his original death!" "get it? i explained it for u!!!" Okay well because of that i gave it a 3, it got a 3 cuz the movie was good but the ending was a big let down.

Bale, Jackman, and Caine, now that sounded like it should've been the best movie one could've wanted to see at theatre. I give you at first I kept thinking it was sort of like Batman versus Wolverine. This movie had the potential to be a great film but at best it was a mediocre attempt at a mysterious period piece. The two main characters were unsympathetic and the others were merely window dressings for their obsessions. I am not really all that much of a Caine fan but I can easily say that he did the best performance of these actors. Even though most of the acting was barely on par, the script and editing were far worse. The timing and movement of this piece took it from a passable film to dreadfully long one. The problem with its length is that it gives you so much time that you figured out all the twists and after that what's the point? I felt mislead with this film as well, it was far more of a revenge flick than a historical fiction. If you are interested in magicians and period pieces try the Illusionist. It was a much better constructed film.

This movie was a disappointment. Both Jackman and Bales looked uncomfortable portraying magicians. Nolan did a nice job of limiting their acts of prestidigitation, but frankly, it wasn't enough. There was no flamboyance; nothing to make the characters stand out as leading illusionists.Major flaws: There was no explanation as to how the great Danton became so wealthy, wealthy enough to buy his transference machine from Tesla, another boring and disappointing performance.It was obvious from the start that Bales had a twin brother in disguise, and one could easily guess that they switched off doing roles on stage and performing in the boudoir. The unveiling of this secret was... nothing.The whole idea of a machine that created a carbon copy of Danton every performance was just plain dumb. Nikola Tesla was not a mystical character, historically, and to portray him as someone who could transcend the laws of physics was insulting to those of us with more than animal intelligence.I have not yet seen The Illusionist, but I'm sure the performances by Norton and Giamatti will be much better. It can hardly be possible that they could be worse.Mike

I HATED this film. From the mumbling bumbling dialog to the so-called "twisted" ending.... Did not know who was who... so you all say that what was great about it.... I didn't think so. I found it very hard to follow. Worst movie I've seen in a long time. Did not know what was going on, past, present or future....who knows. I had a very difficult time understanding what Christian Bale was saying, they all spoke so softly, plus the accents! The movie ended and all I could say was what a waste of time. It was way too long too! Save yourself a lot of thinking and see The Illusionist! Much, much better movie, better acting and very entertaining!

The perfect example of a great cast wasted. It's a remarkably uninteresting movie in which the "surprise" ending was pitifully easy to spot. The fact that the ending was obvious is secondary to the fact that each of the main characters were extremely unlikable individuals. What a waste of talent.The film is a pale shadow of the source material. The director tries to misdirect the viewer with an intricate flashback structure that begins at a trial, before time-traveling through the lives of the magicians as young men. The magicians fall in love with various women while escalating their nasty attempts to expose, outdo and injure each other.Their obsession to obtain each other's trade secrets and become the most esteemed illusionist becomes dull and falls somewhere on the scale between weird science and bad science, this plot development adds another layer of nonsense to the drama. There's no real magic here. For more likable characters and better sleight-of-hand storytelling, see The Illusionist.

thats right i enjoy Hugh Jackman & Christian bale movies but this just caused me pain its been a month & i am still recovering from this boring explosion,my whole body is in pain.all the actors looks bored & Christopher Nolan what is wrong with this guy his batman films are good but when he picks up a camera he loves to film in the night or even in the daylights cant shoot a scene with proper light.& please the length of the film is 2 hours please stop trolling the audiencenow lets get to the plot OK all the critics & people who praise this movie i hate them no seriously i get the plot tow guys want to be the best in the business of magic & be ultimate bale & Hugh Jackman were on coke that day when they signed this film.all that twists in the movie until the end i knew one of them was gonna lose it would have been nice if they both were cool & walked away.& that big machine & crazy science stuff is a joke what these guy are drinking i want that.i am saying is please don't hate me for my review a lot of people are gonna thumb me down specially Nolan fans guys i like Nolan but i don't droll over him.so please forgive me if i don't like this OK.my rating is 2/10 for some nice magic show but stay away from this movie i say because the prestige is for sleepy people only

"It is inhuman to be so cold", says one of the film's characters, and that's what "The Prestige" (2006) directed by Christopher Nolan is above all. It is technically well done, it is dark, it is twisted (too many twists to my taste) and it could be described as "Memento" meets "Rashômon" judging by the way the story of obsession, rivalry, hatred, and losing all human feelings has been told. Yes, it is well done by in the end I don't care about any of its main characters because more than anything, their story reminds of Atreus and Thyestes, two brothers from the Greek Mythology where each would go very far to hurt and to humiliate the sibling. The tricks are magic but when there is nothing but hatred (and some science fiction thrown in for more effect) behind the magic, I don't want to be tricked. I prefer "The Illusionist" that was released the same year -there is love and light behind the secrets and tricks, and I want to stay there.

All I want to tell you about The Prestige is that it definitely suffers from the Kayzer Soze syndrome. For those who do not know who Kayzer Soze is -- go watch The Usual Suspects. Since the release of that film there have been quite a lot of Hollywood releases that have tried to copy the formula from Usual Suspects. The problem is, however, 1) the formula is sucked dry by now, and 2) in order to amuse the audience, they need to feel respected and not be messed with. It's not the amount of plot twists that matters, it's the quality. The Usual Suspects had a single plot twist and it was a brilliant one. The Prestige has a whole bunch of twists, none of which are credible or intelligent. And, one must not forget (SPOILER ALERT), the only one dumb enough to use the twin brother concept as a cover-up for plot holes, is Jean-Claude van Damme. Oh, and I must admit, apart from the plot, the acting, cinematography and directing itself is pretty good. Especially Jackman has shown to be more than a mere Muscles from Brussels or whatever town he's from.

Why Christopher Nolan's movies are so popular? Until you understand that, you will continue to wonder why people spend a lot of money and time to be imprisoned into dull and boring movies; Christopher Nolan knows exactly what he's doing, and he's known it from the start. And what's that he's got for you? A prefabricated universe dominated by figures with no soul and lungs: his audience likes the excitement of drowning their little imagination again and again; for them, films have to be that deadening and useless - and once they have watched them, they might say 'that was really good' a great many time before they get reanimated - lol! that is all right, because their understanding is so nimble to realize their error, which will be forgotten much more quickly than a dream.

Great movie!!! .. or so I thought. Christopher Nolan is a good director. Not a great one, but a good director. This, and other works of his, prove that.6/10 may be my fault since I raised my expectations quite high for this one. I heard about it, and decided to delight myself with a 'masterpiece'.To be objective, the film could've scored 7-8/10, but only if there were a permanent power failure in the world and I wouldn't have seen the finale.Tesla teleporting hats, cats and people for a living? Come on! That means that Friedrich Nietzsche was selling donuts to buy Jaguar wheels. That was disappointing.I understand that film is 90% fiction, but Nolan, next time stay away from putting real (historical) figures do some fictional facts. Nobody likes it.The other 99% of the movie, is filled with thrill, a great plot, some good situation turns and such.I really couldn't say that I wasted 130 minutes of my life. I wasted only 5 with this movie. Even the credits were more interesting than the finale.Tip: If you're reading this and planning to watch the movie, throw soda on your TV near the end, and don't buy a new one. That way you'll really like this movie! Over and out!

Maybe it has to do with the fact that I didn't like much Memento or Batman begins ( following was quite nice though) but seeing the name Christopher Nolan made me doubt to watch the movie. But of course , as a die hard film fan, I did and again I was left unsatisfied. Positive : actors : Hugh Jackman / Christian Bale, inside look in some (the "gruesome" birdcage)magic tricksNegative :long dreaded, not particularly amusing, not much character deepening, story.Overall : At a certain moment i just wanted the movie to end. And I don't have that often. Probably you have to be a Nolan fan. If you are not don't bother watching this film

"The Prestige" wasn't really a bad movie, but it did try too hard to be altogether too clever. The problem isn't the cast who are uniformly excellent. The problem is the plot and the script which simply have too many holes, compounded by confusing presentation which jumps back and forth through time and expects the audience to keep up. Not that it's really that hard to keep up, but in the end I got the feeling that it was all just fancy footwork to keep you from realizing just how weak the plot really was.WARNING: Spoiler ahead!Without trying to spoil too much, the ending was especially lame and ultimately unsatisfying. Specifically, it morphed without warning from a well-executed character-driven picture with involving the mechanics and psychology of illusion, into a sci-fi film - and not a very good one at that. Nicola Tesla's descendants should sue everyone involved!A great actor's showcase, but still not recommended...

A better title for this movie should have been "Two Jerks as Magicians." This movie contained two of the most unlikable characters maybe in movie history. Hugh Jackman and Christian play rival magicians who try to outdo each other. Both sacrifice personally for their actions. Scarlett Johansson play the woman caught between th two. She realizes that both of these guys are jerks. So why does the movie tack some kind of mega happy ending where one character lives happily ever after. This film cries out for a darker ending in which both Bale and Jackman get their comeuppance at the end. If you want a story about magic, watch The Illusionist instead. It is superior to this movie in every way shape and form.

Hugely disappointing effort here. I was expecting better from Nolan, after the great "Batman Begins", but this was a real letdown. The story is disjointed and confusing in that it keeps jumping back and forth in time so much that you lose the time line, and it all gets muddled. You're not sure what is taking place when. The dialogue is lacking and the direction is not nearly as inspired as I'd hoped. Christian Bale is more effective playing Americans than Brits somehow, and his Cockney accent is not very convincing. Jackman is underwhelming. The major secret of the film is so absurd and deflating that I felt cheated as the credits popped up. If you want to see a "Turn of the Century Magic Movie", rent "The Illusionist" a much more elegant film, and although it relies more on the supernatural and the suspension of disbelief, it is far less ridiculous and contrived than this dung heap.

This movie sucked big time , i mean that with batman and wolverine a little more action was needed OK. The twist at the end was very much predictable and it went from illusion to science. The illusionist was better but not by much. Don't see it, or rent something else instead.So we better expect better from Nolan with batman 2. And Hugh Jackman with wolverine the movie. I mean Johansen was good but not great, and Caine needed a little more soul and heart like in Batman begins. The cinematography was very good actually, so was the art direction, But the editing and the flashbacks, back and forward, was not very good, and a little confusing sometimes.

Maybe my expectations for the new Christopher Nolan film were too high, but after I saw it I was extremely disappointed. Of course a good movie doesn't need a plot full of surprising twists, but from the introduction of Fallon early on until the last shot I kept hoping 'please let there be something I am missing'. I was wrong. The first time I saw Fallon, I knew he was a double for 'Borden'. You could easily see it was Bale with a hat, fake nose and hair...Also Sarah's 'today you (don't) love me's made it all too clear. By never showing Fallon's face, or sometimes just plain ignoring him, Nolan made me too curious about him. And it annoyed me. Does Nolan think his post-6th Sense-Fight Club-audience is stupid?And what about that last shot? Was that supposed to shock us? It was immediately obvious when Borden tried to help Angiers from drowning, Angiers was drowning all his 'copies'. Even before that he gave us a lot (too much) of clues (the birds, hats, cats, etc.). It was almost as if he was afraid we wouldn't get it, almost the opposite of Memento.A lot of reviews talk about how good the story was told. Yeah that's right, the story was pre-chewed, pre-microwave-over-cooked and spoon-fed to me. If you wanna see a well made film that doesn't insult it's audience intelligence watch Guy Ritchie's very underrated Revolver...

When I read a few comments on the film and checked the IMDb rating, just before watching the movie, expectancies were high.And I must say, it is a very well made movie. The cast is good, the acting is solid, really no problem there. Same goes for the decors, photography - the movie is a joy to watch, even if the part in the icy woods in Colorado Springs felt very artificial, plastic - like.Only one weak point then as far as I'm concerned: the plot. I felt it was very predictable, from, let's say, the second half of the movie on. The fact that "real magic" (a machine that duplicates objects or creatures) was used in the plot, was a major disappointment to me. A beautiful movie then. But not really an intelligent one. Overrated if you ask me. Good entertainment, but nothing more. I gave it a 6/10.

I loved this movie. It was like watching David Copperfield or better Houdini. The entire movie kept me guessing. Don't miss the first 5 minutes or you will be lost through the entire movie. At my theater there was no previews. So there were many people who came in late. I am going to see it again, just so I can really enjoy it. Now that I know how it ends. This will surprise you. THis is not a movie for children under ten, because they will be asking through the entire movie, "What just happened". This movie I think will be one of the movies that will be watched 10 or 20 years from now, It is timeless and will be considered a classic. Have fun.

I just came from seeing the movie and it is now by far my favorite movie of all time. I had hoped this movie would be as good as the trailer made it seem, and it DEFINITELY was. I really don't like all the mainstream crap that's stamped out like a cookie cutter, so this dark, intelligent, fun, and imaginative movie was great. And it really keeps you thinking--trying to figure out what you just saw after it's over. Great acting, time-period setting, and twisting plot too. Just a great all around movie. Can't think of anything else it reminds me of really. The confusing nature and multi-level plot and meaning reminds me a little of "Lost Highway."ONLY thing I didn't like was a couple birds dying.

The Prestige a Review by Lacy McKayThe newest Christopher Nolan (Memento, Batman Begins) release is The Prestige, out today. It is an intricate story with delicate details that require the viewer's undivided attention.The Prestige details an intense rivalry of two turn-of-the-century magicians. This rivalry is ignited by Alfred Borden's (played by Christian Bale) accidental (or is it?) killing of Rupert Angier's (Hugh Jackman) magician's assistant wife. From the moment she dies, the two set out to out do each other in increasingly dangerous and awe-inspiring tricks. Their passions take them from London to Denver and back again. There are so many swaps in advantage that the viewer is almost challenged to figure out the next.Christopher Nolan does here what he does best: provides a chronologically disconjointed film with a story that almost instantly draws you into a world you are only vaguely familiar with. Also, as per Nolan's pattern, the story is never what it seems. The obsession of Angier turns dark and scary. His degeneration of his character is almost shocking.Casting here is very well done. Bale and Jackman are very convincing and draw us into their characters' dark, mysterious worlds where secrets and deception are not only important to their work, but essential to their beings. Scarlett Johanssen steps out of her recent, vampy roles to put on a convincing performance as both Bale's and Jackman's mistress/assistant. There are also great performances put on by a very strong supporting cast of Michael Caine (as the machinist behind Jackman's tricks), David Bowie (as a scientific mastermind, Tesla), and Andy Serkis (as Tesla's assistant).This is one of the top wide releases this year. Definitely a must see.9/10pace.

What a waste of talent. So many good actors and acctresses in this film. Yet, that couldn't save Christopher Nolan from creating one of the most boring movies I've ever watched.The story itself is an interesting concept and the execution lacking. Magicians with a rivalry willing to do whatever it takes to best one another.

Love this film despite all its conundrums.It has been postulated that in the Prestige (the third part of any magic "trick"): the trick is right in front of us, but it is not easy to spot. It is established that when Angier uses the Box, the double is produced practically instantaneously. The scene where Borden rages about how quickly Angier (which we know to be the double) appears on the balcony underlines that the film-maker wants the viewers to know it (at least, if we are paying attention). Why, then, (and this is the fundamental point) does the double fail to appear on the night that Borden barges backstage?It has been suggested there are two explanations. First, it has been suggested that the copy hears Borden as he hacks at the tank containing the original Angier. Yet we are shown several seconds of silence, at the end of which we hear Borden shouting from underneath the stage. If the Angier copy simply hears Borden, then we need to explain why he didn't appear within a second as in every other performance. An alternative explanation is that Angier allowed Borden to sabotage the show, in order to see him jailed. But the same problem applies: either Angier and his latest clone are telepathic, or they knew he was coming in advance. And neither of these possibilities is suggested in the movie, nor, for that matter, the original novel. Nevertheless, Angier's clone does survive; in fact, the narrative relies upon it.Although the person postulating this says this makes no sense it is clear the first theory is incorrect whilst the second is obvious but it is not the clone that survives but the real AngierI shall be watching this again

A movie that keep you in it from the start to the end. The first thing I thought of at the end of the movie was to ask myself when I was going to be able to watch it again. A good intrigue that keeps on going in which you really try to understand what is going on. A good acting game that makes it all fabulous. In addition, we learn a lot about magic and how a magic trick is organized so that it is successful. This is just one of my favorite movies, if you have not seen it, do not wait anymore!

The first time I saw The Prestige I was absolutely blown away by it. I was staring at the screen, slack jawed, halfway through the credits. The twist ending in this is phenomenal and mind-bending... the first time. Once you know the twist, however, it seems like the film has no point. Watch it once, have your mind blown and then just let that be the film experience you associate with this film, because the second time is just disappointing.

I watched the movie (and read the book) because IMDb reviewers slammed "Now You See Me" and said real magic movies, like The Prestige and the Illusionist, are what filmmaking is all about. Well, I can say the Prestige was better than the Illusionist. And both were pieces of crud.Enter the adaptation of a bad book, The Prestige. The setup is simple - two rival magicians try to outdo each other, and their game escalates until people start getting seriously hurt. That should be easy enough to pull off, no? No. Here comes the sci-fi element that has absolutely nothing to do with the illusions the magicians were attempting before. Suddenly, what could have been a believable, but slow, plodding, and boring, period tale is now utter nonsense. And, the critical details about the sci-fi element are only told at the very end of the movie. At least the book let you warm up to the nonsense.The relationship between Bale and Johansen gets exactly two lines. And that is an incredibly important part of the story! The book treats this better, and the book was awful.This could be the movie that keeps me off of IMDb forever. You people are nuts if this is a 8/9 out of 10. The only good part of the experience was knowing I got the movie from the library, so this nonsense didn't cost me a dime.

Just in case the reader of this review has not watched this movie somehow. I've included no spoilers. I just watched The Prestige again now some 8 years later after its original release with some friends. Even though I still remembered a bit of what to expect in this twisting, turning show. Was still blown away by this first rate movie! My friends who were privileged in it being there first viewing. Had an even more high tend experience as the credits rolled. Yet because its such a well done show. In its direction of story, screen play, and acting. It all comes together to make a timeless treasure! A movie your going to enjoy again and again. Its movie magic and will entertain people forever! Don't miss out on this movie. This is why movies are made.

Authentic tricks , Shallow deaths, deadly secrets, a twisted plot and a painful obsession. Once again Christopher Nolan has brought us another sensational film. I just recently watched this movie and felt the need to watch it a second time. In this dramatic thriller Alfred Borden (christian Bale) and Robert Angier(Hugh Jackman) try to discomfit each other in becoming the better magician. Robert Angier started off as brilliant as Berenice but then towards the end of the film became malefic. You will descry shocking conclusions about these characters. The complex plot twist makes this film even better in a way that leaves you wanting more. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman did a fabulous job playing their roles.The way how everything is filmed just compels you. You may have to watch the movie again to have a truly better understanding of what has happened. I strongly recommend this brilliant film."Abra Cadabra" -tasha

I think this film is a vastly under-rated feature and is one of Nolan's best in terms of the narrative and plot. The film is great in that it keeps you thinking throughout with it's woven non-linear structure and the cast that are in the film seem perfect for their respective characters, the film charts the personal and professionally rivalry between two magicians in the Victorian age with each ruining each others performances in a different number of ways before building up to it's twist of a climax, Michael Caine plays his role well as the fatherly figure for Algier (Hugh Jackman)whilst the leading cast play it well as two men obsessed with topping the other as things take a turn for the worst the more the film plays out, for me Bale's character Borden is the better of the two but Jackman still puts in a great performance.

This is my first Christopher Nolan movie and was curious to see his movie after so much buzz about his direction so We rented an DVD it was such a crap CD it took 5 hours and 2 systems plus four media planners and YouTube to watch climax, it was very tiring exercise because of crap CD still we took so much effort because we liked the movie!!This is the movie of two friends turned foes because of personal and professional reasons. Alfred Borden played by Christian Bale who is innovative, ready to work hard and take dangerous risks to come with breathtaking illusions and Robert Angier played by Hugh Jackman ,he is very good presenter who can enthrall audience with his presentation skills. They share complimentary skills. Unfortunately their complimentary skill doesn't make them partners but rivals. Difference begins when Julia played by Piper Perabo accidentally dies during performance and Borden doesn't clarify how he tied the knot during performance, so angier considers him responsible for his wife death. If there is such a fundamental difference between relationships it can only become worse. Then the rivalry begins between two to such an extent both appears on each other stage to destroy the performance one another.Finally Borden performs an ultimate illusion which wasn't done by any one before THE TRANSPORTED MAN, Which puts Angier into great obsession to do the same or perform something better than this or steal it from him and perform it through his excellent presentation skills. He does same illusion with the help of cutter (Michael Caine) his guru and his double. But not satisfied doing with double and thinks Borden is doing alone wants to know the trick and decides to send his assistant Olivia played by Scarlett Johansson to steal the trick from Bordan but she feels betrayed as she was in love with him and instead stealing the trick for Angier she decides to join Borden and take revenge against angier and reveals the trick angier is doing it do in his version transported man ,so Borden approaches angier double and convinces threats he can come across by being an double and woos him to his side and during much hyped and much awaited performance of Angier, Bordan appears in the place of Angier double and destroys the show, this puts angier in deep humiliation and deeply disturbed and decides to come up with an illusion which answer Bordan then he approaches Olivia to know why she betrayed him and manages to take dairy of Bordan against her will and takes his journey to places meets Tesla to come up with illusion never done before. Tesla is a scientist who was working on some next generation electricity machine and Angier decides to invest in the project which could help him in his illusion. So far it is good Then it become sillier and sillierFinally Tesla delivers it but has to runaway because was under attack by Einstein men. What the machine does, It emits electricity from different direction which looks like thunder, anyone who stands in it and receives electricity it will produce a double nearby place. This is so silly I don't need to tell who silly it is. He takes the machine even thou Tesla advices him to be very careful with it. Finally he realizes he has got what he was looking for. He decides to perform it in best theater in town and to large number of audience so he approaches his guru cutter to arrange for such a show and manage from front. Show was super successful and does one hundred such shows which finally move Bordan to watch his show and find out the trick behind it. Once Angier is performing the show and gets inside the floor Bordan moves towards the show to check it. Angier falls into water tank and starts feeling suffocating and locks gets closed he can't come out, Bordan takes an iron rod and starts hitting the glass to save him but wasn't successful and Bordan is taken to custody for killing him and sentenced to death and he will orphaning his daughter. Angier appears back to tell Bordan he is better than him. Bordan was shocked and surprised at this but he is helpless now. He is hanged then Angier decides to abandon his machine as it has served its purpose. He is standing near his machine being proud of his victory. He is shot by Bordan now it's time for Angier to shocked and surprised looking at Borden. Finally Borden reveals his trick of transported man He simply used double. His double loved Julia and his wife died because she thought he wasn't honest with her and he could not reveal his secret because of him. This comes as deep shock for Angier and dies. This came as deep shock for me also how come both find a double that identical and perform what they ask. This is story put in a straightforward way but Nolan has done an outstanding job I don't know what the industry word is for it I would refer it frame twisting how he has done it is better watched but I really like his approach. Even though some looks funny overall movie was good performance by all roles are fantastic. It is well paced and explains very well what really happens in magic behind the scenes that what made movie interesting for me.Finally,I would definitely like to see all his movies.

I really enjoyed this film and Christian Bale turns in yet another solid performance in Christopher Nolan's capable hands. I'll admit that it didn't take me very long to figure out most of the Jackman side of the plot but I freely admit that I never considered the 'twins' twist. I barely recognized Scarlett Johansson and Michael Caine did his usual seamless work.I was confused for a bit but when the story threads started to come together, I began to really get into it. The story was fascinating and David Bowie as Tesla was an inspired casting choice, adding just the right touch of murky mysteriousness. The sets were just awesome and the cinematography was spot on, conveying a dark but not oppressive mood. I usually judge a film by the impression that it leaves (or doesn't) on me hours or even days after viewing it, and this one had me running through all of the puzzle pieces in my mind for some time afterward. It was dark and somber but not enough to make one feel like it was a 'downer' experience. It did, however, leave me in a contemplative state of mind--and that's a good thing. This was a smartly written, solid piece of entertainment on all fronts.***-As a side note, I wish that Chris Nolan would get another sound designer---I'm sick of all of his movies having dialogue that you can barely hear, even with your sound system cranked up, only to have the next scene rattling the windows!***

The Prestige. Where do we begin? Let's name all the good things about this movie: Chirstopher Nolan, Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine, the plot. Despite allegedly being nothing like the book The Prestige, Nolan directed a spectacular film. Part of it was how Nolan put the scenes all out of order, yet you lost no sense of what took place in what order. In addition, the scenes were in just the order to make you say, "Wow, that makes total sense now!" at the end of the movie. For instance, the movie opens with a shot that you don't think about until many scenes later at which point you go exclaim the aforementioned exclamation. Bale, Jackman, and Caine did stellar performances in The Prestige. Bale masterfully played Alfred Borden, the great magician couldn't book a decent theater, or make his tricks look good. Jackman was incredible as Robert Angier, the not-as-good, yet obsessed magician who could make his tricks look like something unbelievable. Michael Caine, also did amazing as the illusion engineer who was the source of most of Angier's tricks. The Prestige's plot was full of twists, turns, and parts that made made you say "Woah." Upon re-watching the movie, one notices that the script is riddled with hints that reveal the end. The plot contains a bitter rivalry, revenge, and things you have to notice to figure it out before the movie ends. Once the ending is revealed, the audience's jaw drops when the end is not what it seems. The cover to the DVD says "You want to see it again the second its over." That's probably the best way to put it. The first time you watch it , you're not really looking for how the story comes together, you want to be shocked. 10 stars. This movie was awesome.
